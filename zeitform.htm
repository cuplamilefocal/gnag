<h3>
<a name="Präsens"></a><span class="lightgreen">present tense (an aimsir láithreach)</span></h3>
Non-habitual present tense and habitual present tense have a <i>common</i> form.
<br>
(<i>bí</i> is the only verb with separate forms for <i>habitual</i> and
<i>non-habitual</i>) <a name="fnverweis1">[</a> <a href="#fn1">1</a> ] <br>
The usage differs:
<ul>
  <li><b>In written language,</b> the present tense form like German or English
    present tense (habitual and non-habitual) is used, as well as by continuing
    actions of the dt.perfect. In this category count also e.g. sports commentary
    or sermons.</li>
  <li><b>Colloquially,</b> it is only understood with <i>verbs of thought, feeling
    and the five senses</i> as the non-habitual present tense- for punctual actions
    in the present. The decisive factor with these verbs is the context, if habitual
    or non habitual present tense is meant. <br>
    (e.g.: non-habitual: <i>Feiceann sé anois = he sees now</i>, habitual:
    <i>Feiceann sé go minic = he sees often</i>) <br>
    With all <i>other verbs</i>, this form colloquially only means the <i>habitual</i>
    present tense. <br>
    (e.g.: <i>Glanann sé go minic = he cleans often</i>) <br>
    Simple, non-habitual present tense is colloquially rather written with the
    <a href="#Verlaufsform">progressive</a>. <br>
    (e.g. <i>Tá sé ag glanadh anois = he's cleaning now</i>)</li>
</ul>
This use is quite similar to the English. <br>
The use of the present tense in place of the future (in the German e.g. "wenn
wir kommen"="if we come" <i>instead of </i> "wenn wir kommen werden"="if
we will come") is not common, (mostly the future is used: e.g. <i>nuair
a thiocfaimid = if we will come</i>), except after <i>má = if</i> and <i>cha
= not</i> (see <a href="#Futur">future</a>)
<p>In the <a href="satz4.htm#Direkter%20Relativsatz">direct relative clause</a>:
  there is a special <a href="#relativ">relative form</a> with an s-suffix in
  the 3rd person. <br>
  e.g: <i>an fear a ghlana(nn)s an carr = the man who is cleaning the car</i>.
  <br>
  Synthetic suffixes remain unchanged. e.g.: <i>an carr</i> <i>a ghlanaim = the
  car that I clean</i>.
<p>Only seldom there is, in der 3rd person, a <b><i>historical present tense (an
  láithreach stairiúil)</i></b>, that appears in narratives (otherwise
  in the preterite), as a stilistic tool to make a current action "more present".
  Instead of <i>-ann</i> in Ulster the old present tense suffix <b class="red">-(a)idh</b>
  is used. e.g.: <i>Glanaidh sé = he cleans</i>. One may also use the relative
  form <b class="red">-(e)as</b> , even if no relative connection
  is present: e.g.: <i>Glanas Seán na soithí = Seán cleans
  the dishes</i>
<h3>
<a name="habitPräsens"></a><b><span class="lightgreen"><font size="+1">habitual present tense (an aimsir gnáthláithreach)</span></font></b></h3>
Obviously there is a difference in Irish between the 2 aspects of action: <i>habitual</i>
and <i>non-habitual</i> (somewhat comparable to the Russian perfect and imperfect
aspect) <br>
The habitual present tense exsists as its own form only for the verb <a href="bi.htm">bí</a>
= to be. <br>
<i>Tá sé = he is </i> (present tense) <br>
<i>Bíonn sé = he is</i> (habit. present tense) <br>
For all other verbs there is only one <i>common</i> form for non-habitual and
habitual present tense. Colloquially, mostly the habitual present tense is meant
(except with verbs of the thought, feeling and the senses) <br>
It is used for actions, that <b>regularly (<i>normally, generally, often, sometimes,
seldom, never</i>)</b> take place
<p>In the <a href="satz4.htm#Direkter%20Relativsatz">direct relative clause</a>:
  there is a special form with an s-suffix (e.g. <i>a bhíos = that is</i>,
  in Conamara <i>a bhíonns</i>) <br>
  e.g: <i>an carr a bhíos glan i gcónaí = the car that is
  generally is clean.</i>
<h3>
<a name="Präteritum"></a><span class="lightgreen">preterite (an aimsir chaite)</span></h3>
The preterite is used like the German preterite. It is, although, additionally
used in the situations where the German perfect and plusquamperfect is used. It
describes a one time (punctual) action in the past. <br>
It is the normal narrative form in prose.. <br>
e.g. <i>Chonaic mé = I saw, I have seen, I had seen</i>
<p><font size="-1"> Just a side - (to explain the conjugation different from the
  other tenses ): <br>
  The preterite suffixes stem from the singular (-as, -is, -) of the old Irish.
  s-preterite,but in the plural (-amar, -abhar, -adar) the former deponential
  (passive-) conjugation. </font>
<h3>
<a name="Imperfekt"></a><span class="lightgreen">imperfect (an aimsir neamhfhoirfe) or habitual preterite (an aimsir gnáthchaite)</span></h3>
The imperfect is the habitual form in the past. It us used similar to the <a href="#habitPräsens">habitual
present tense</a>. But it is, as opposed to that, available for all verbs as an
individual form. It describes a recurring or continuous (non-punctual) action
in the past (Engl.: "I used to ...") <br>
In form, it's the same as the subjunctive-preterite, but here, lenition and a
d'-prefix occurs<br>
e.g.: <i>Dhéanadh sé an obair go maith = He did (normally, regularly,
...) the work well.</i>
<h3>
<a name="Futur"></a><span class="lightgreen">future (an aimsir fháistineach)</span></h3>
The future is used like the German future I, where often also a desired event
in the future is played out: <i>Beidh deoch agam = I would (like) to have a drink</i>
<br>
A use of the present tense in place of the future (as in German) is not common,
except sometimes by the verb <i>bí</i>. <br>
After the conjunction <i>má = if</i> and the verbal particle <i>cha = not</i>
the habitual present tense always follows instead of the future. <br>
e.g. <i>Glanfaidh tú = you will clean</i>: <i>má ghlanann tú
= if you clean/will clean</i>, <i>cha ghlanann tú = you don't clean/will
not clean</i>
<p>In the <a href="satz4.htm#Direkter%20Relativsatz">direct relative clause</a>
  there is, as in the present tense, a special <a href="#relativ">relative form</a>
  with an s-suffix. <br>
  e.g: <i>an fear a ghlanfas an carr = the man who will clean the car.</i>
<h3><a name="Perfekt"></a><span class="lightgreen">perfect (an aimsir fhoirfe)</span></h3>

<p>The perfect is, as a tense, used much more seldomly (as in German or English),
  instead of this mostly the preterite is used, or the present tense for continuing
  actions. <br>
  The Irish perfect can only be used, if the action has just recently ended (vgl.
  dt. term "vollendete Gegenwart"=present perfect) and is appears necessary to
  mention this condition; or if the condition/the result of the action is to be
  described (similar to the perfect in Greek).It is not a dependent tense as in
  English (independent from conjunctions, adverbs or other subordinating clauses).
  <br>
  There is also no simple formation of the perfect using a conjugation as a suffix;
  <br>
  Instead, compound forms (periphrastic forms) with the auxilliary verb <a href="bi.htm">bí</a>
  are used, that often have a passive meaning. <br>
  Through preterite forms of bí a sorf of perfect preterite (plusquamperfekt)
  is formed, through future forms, a future perfect (in German future II).

<p><font size="-1"> *:in Irish, subject and object are actually the other way
  around, the rendering here is more based on a German grammar<br>
  The fact that in Irish that subject and object are switched also means that
  this construction actually is a passive-perfect is. </font>
<p>With <b>transitive</b> verbs, this is basically a perfect <a href="#Passiv">passive</a>
  form (see below). <br>
  It can, when relocated, also be translated as an active-perfect (because <b>bí
  + ag</b> means "<i><a href="modal.htm#haben">have</a></i>") <br>
  e.g.: <i>Tá an bord briste agam = I have broken the table/ the table
  was broken by me.</i> (lit.: "The table is broken at-me") <br>
  With <b>transitive</b> verbs that only have an <b>indirect objecte</b> (preposition
  + object, e.g. <i>beir ar rud = catch something</i>), the preposition remains
  the same also with the verbal adjective and introduced the logical subject (a
  grammat. subject is missing). This is also mainly passive<br>
  e.g.: <i>Tá beirthe ort = you are caught</i>, <i>Tá beirthe agam
  ort = I caught you.</i> <br>
  With <b>intransitive</b> verbs this has naturally only a perfect and no passivie
  meaning. <br>
  e.g.: <i>Tá siad imithe go hÉirinn = The went away to Ireland</i>.
  <br>
  The result of the action is always in the foreground. (in the examples: "the
  table is broken", "you are caught", "they are away").

<p>This form puts the emphasis on the fact that an action was completed just now.

<p>This form emphasises the status of an action and is passive. Technically seen,
  it acts as a passive participle (<i>ar oscailt = "being open"</i>). <br>
  In this use <b>no lenition</b> occurs after ar. <br>
  e.g.: <i>Tá an clog ar stad. = The clock has stopped. Tá an doras
  ar oscailt = The door is opened.</i> <br>

<p>The form with <a href="verbnom1.htm#nachdem">do + subject</a> is the "real"
  perfect: (<i>ar</i> comes from <b><i>iar = after </i></b>). Instead of ar one
  can also use <i>tar éis</i> etc. (see more about that under <a href="verbnom1.htm#nachdem">syntax
  of the verbal noun</a>) <br>
  But this form is only usable as a subordinating clause or adverbially, not as
  an independent clause. It describes the preclusion of the action (with respect
  to the action of the main clause) <br>
  In this use, ar <b>lenites</b> (earlier there was eclipsis after iar/ar) <br>
  e.g.: <i>Ar oscailt an dorais dom = After I had opened the door, ar dhéanamh
  na hoibre duit = after you have done the work.</i> <br>
  In combination with the possessive pronoun a/ár one gets the forms <b class="red">arna/arnár</b>
  (e.g. <i>arna ól dom = after I have drunk it </i> lit.: "after-its drinking
  to-me"). <br>
  These occur also in <a href="verbnom1.htm#ar">verbal noun constructions</a>
  as the perfect passive participle (e.g. <i>arna chur in fhoilsiú ag ...
  = published by...</i>) without do + subject.</p>

<h2>
<span class="red">Modus (an modh)</span></h2>

<h3>
<a name="indikativ"></a><span class="lightgreen">indicative (an modh táscach)</span></h3>
The indicative is the <i>form dealing with reality</i>, of normal statement-
and narrative forms in all above mentioned tenses. <br>
(I am, I was, I will be, etc.). It is with that the most common form.
<h3>
<a name="Imperativ"></a><span class="lightgreen">imperative (an modh ordaitheach)</span></h3>
The imperative is the <i>command form</i>, used for commands and requests. <br>
Es gibt ihn nur in einer tense (present tense)
<br>
One can divide it into:
<ul>
  <li> the<i><b class="lightgreen">"primary imperative"</b></i> an independent
    form (2nd person singular/plural) <br>
    This is used as in German or English: <br>
    e.g. <i>glan! = clean!(sg.); glanaigí! = clean!</i>(pl.) <br>
    the 2nd person singular is also termed <i>verb root</i> and is the base form
    as found in dictionaries</li>
  <li>as the <i><b class="lightgreen">"secondary imperative"</b></i>
    one actually uses verb forms of other Modi. <br>
    A secondary imperative is less common in German/English (with the forms of
    the subjunctive-present tense: <i>Gehe er!=Go he!</i>). Instead, in German/English
    one uses reworded sayings (like: "laßt uns..."="let us...",
    "er soll..."="he should..." etc.). In Irish:
    <ul type="disc">
      <li> the forms 1st person singular ("let me...") and the autonomous form
        ("one should...") are identical to the forms of the <i>indicative present
        tense</i>. A difference is mostly only possible to find from the context:
        <br>
        <i>Glanaim = I clean, let me clean</i>. <br>
        It is only clear by the irregular verbs with different stems: <br>
        <i>Deirim = I say</i>, <i>Abraím = let me say!</i></li>
      <li> the forms of the 3rd person singular and plural (<b>jussive:</b> "he
        should...", "they should....") as well as the 1st person plural (<b>hortative:</b>
        "let us..") are identical with the forms of the <i>indicative-imperfect</i>
        (<i>subjunctive-preterite</i>), but they occur without lenition. <br>
        <i>Glanadh sé = he should clean!</i>, <i>Glanaimis = let us clean!</i>
        <br>
        In the 1st person plural there was once a form with a broad -m : <i>Téam
        = let us go.</i> (instead of <i>téimis</i>) <br>
        Often, in the 1st peson plural, also the indicative-present tense suffix
        -imid is used: <i>Téimid = let us go.</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
For the negative imperative (<b>prohibitive</b>) there is an own <b><i>negating
particle (prohibitive particle)</i> <span class="red">ná</span></b>
( e.g.: <i>ná glan é! = don't clean it!</i>) <br>
In this way, negativen clauses are always clear: <br>
<i>Ní ghlanaimid = we don't clean</i>, <i>Ná glanaimid = let us
not clean!</i>
<p>The <b>autonomous form</b> is especially used for prohibit signs. In German
  one uses rather the infinitive, in English, the progressive. <br>
  e.g.: <i>Ná caitear tobac! = No smoking! </i>(lit.: "one uses not tobacco!").
  <br>
  The <b>3rd person (jussive)</b> is especially used in idiomatic phrases, in
  which the grammatical and logical subject are not the same, like: <i>Ná
  bíodh eagla ort! = Have no fear!</i> (lit.: "not be fear on-you")
<p>The use of the imperative is pretty much equivalent to the German. Besides
  these, it is sometimes used in constructions in the meaning "is ... or if not
  ...": <br>
  e.g.: <i>Bíodh sé sásta nó ná bíodh
  = if he is happy or not</i> (lit.: "be he happy or not be")
<h3>
<a name="Konditional"></a><span class="lightgreen">conditional (an modh coinníollach)</span></h3>
This is the <i>conditional form</i>. <br>
That means the action is dependent on certain (named or unnamed) conditions. <br>
In German one uses a rearranged form with "würden"=would (e.g. ich würde
gehen, wenn...) =I would go, if...<br>
And also in the usage it is very similar to the German "würde"- form:
<ul>
  <li>in actions dependent on an (<a href="satz3.htm#Irreale%20Bedingungssätze">irreal</a>)
    condition, e.g. <i>Thiocfadh sé dá ... = He would have come,
    if...</i></li>
  <li>to describe the <a href="satz3.htm#Irreale%20Bedingungssätze">irreal
    condition</a> instead of the subjunctive-preterite (see there), e.g. <i>...
    dá mbeadh an t-am aige = ... if he would have the time.</i></li>
  <li>as a secondary future (after main clauses in the past, e.g. in <a href="indir.htm">indirect
    speech</a>), e.g. <i>Dúirt sé go mbeadh sé ann = He said
    he would be there.</i></li>
  <li>in the use as a polite request (e.g.: <i>An dtabharfá dom an t-im,
    le do thoil? = Would you please give me the butter?</i>)</li>
  <li>in rhetor. questions like <i>Cad a d'fheicfeadh sé ansin ach capall?
    = What did he see there but a horse?</i></li>
</ul>
The conditional exists only in one form, this is for all tenses the same. <br>
e.g.: <i>Rachainn = I would go/I would have gone</i>
<h3>
<a name="Konjunktiv"></a><span class="lightgreen">subjunctive (an modh foshuiteach)</span></h3>
The subjunctive is the <i>possibility form</i> <br>
The subjunctive is only possible in 2 tenses:
<ul>
<li>
<b class="lightgreen">subjunctive present tense (foshuiteach láithreach)</b>

<br>
    Except in the use for wishes, curses, etc. it has mostly been replaced by
    the indicative-future</li>
<li>
<b class="lightgreen">subjunctive preterite (foshuiteach caite)</b>

<br>
    The form of the subjunctive preterite is the same as the indicative imperfect.
    <br>
    It is used in <a href="satz3.htm#Irreale%20Bedingungssätze">irreal conditional
    clauses</a> ( after dá ), but also here mostly replaced by the conditional
  </li>
</ul>
It is (was) used for:
<ul>
  <li>Wishes, curses etc. (<i>subjunctive present tense</i> as the <b>optative</b>)
    with the particle/conjunction <b class="red">go</b> in <a href="satz6.htm#Konjunktivsätze">subjunctive
    clauses</a> <br>
    e.g.: <i>Go raibh maith agat = thank you</i> (lit."that be goodness by you");
    <br>
    the <b><i>negating particle is</i></b> <b class="red">nár</b>
    <br>
    e.g.: <i>Nár éirí sin leat = That it will not come to
    pass for you!</i></li>

  <li>Goal, purpose after <b class="red">go, nó go, sula</b>.
    <br>
    If the main clause is in the present tense, future or imperative, the <i>subjunctive
    present tense</i> follows, <br>
    if the main clause is in the preterite/conditional, the <i>subjunctive preterite</i>
    follows. <br>
    e.g.: <i>Fan go dtaga mé = Wait, until I come</i></li>

  <li>Incomplete actions / indefinite time periods after the temporal conjunctions
    <b class="red">go, nó go, sula, ach a</b>, <br>
    if the main clause is in the present tense, future or imperative, the <i>subjunctive
    present tense</i> follows. <br>
    e.g.: <i>Beidh mé á bhualadh sula bhfeice sé féin
    mé&nbsp; = I will hit him before he sees me</i></li>
  <li>after  <b class="red">mura</b> in <a href="satz3.htm#reale%20Bedingungssätze">real

    in exclamatory clauses of wishes/regret<br>
    (<b>irreal optative</b> in the sense of "had I only...", "if I could only...")
    <br>
    e.g.: <i>Dá nglanadh sé na soithí! = If he had only done
    the dishes!</i> (lit.: "if he the dishes cleaned had!")</li>

<h2>
<span class="red">Genus verbi (an fhaí)</span></h2>

<h3>
<a name="Aktiv"></a><span class="lightgreen">active (an fhaí ghníomhach)</span></h3>
The active is the form that tells us that the subject of the clause is the agent
(e.g. <i>glanann sé = he cleans</i>) <br>
Oppositely, the passive tells us that the logical subject of the clause experiences
something (e.g. <i>tá sé á ghlanadh = he is being cleaned</i>)
<br>
The active exists in all above mentioned tenses and modi (see there)
<h3>
<a name="Passiv"></a><span class="lightgreen">passive (an fhaí chéasta)</span></h3>
<p>The passive is the <i>experiential form</i>. The subject of the clause "experiences"
  an action. <br>

  is used: <br>

<p>e.g.: <i>Tá an bord briste agam. = The table was broken by me. / I broke

  A clause of this sort with the verbal adjective of a transitive verb says that
  something <i>was done</i> (by me) = passive, <br>
  but also that I <i>have</i> done something (<a href="#Perfekt">perfect</a>,
  read more there). <br>
  The passive is always perfective in tense because it always stresses the status
  following an action. <br>
  The agent is included with ag... (comp. <i>bí...ag = have</i>) also:

  e.g.:<i>Déantar é. = It will be done.</i> <br>
  It is not possible to include the agent (<i>by whom</i> it was done). <br>
  The translation of this form into German/English is done with the impersonal
  pronoun <i>man/one</i>: <br>
  e.g.: <i>Déantar é. = One does it.</i> <br>

  This form is similar to the normal <a href="verbnom1.htm">progressive</a> with
  the pronoun as the object, but here, the possessive pronoun is always referring
  to the subject of the clause, and from this we get a progressive-passive construction.

<a name="Verlaufsform"></a><span class="lightgreen">progressive (an fhoirm leanúnach)</span></h3>
As in English, there is also in Irish a special progressive. <br>
This looks similar to the German colloquial form of: (e.g. "I bin am/beim Einkaufen")
= I'm at shopping. (also sim. to the English: The children are <i>at play</i>
) <br>

<p>*instead of <i>bí</i> also verbs of sense, start/finish and motion are
  possible. <br>
  In direct relative-clauses, <i>a</i> (lenites) instead of <i>ag</i>. <br>
  Through a conjugation of bí (or other verbs), the progressive is possible
  in all tenses.<br>
  Important is the difference between the:
<ul>
  <li><b class="lightgreen">progressive in the present tense:</b> <br>
    (similar in the preterite, future) <br>
    used for actions that take place now, or should continue<br>
    e.g.: <i>Tá mé ag feachaint ar an teilifís = I am watching
    TV (right now).</i> <br>
    The progressive in the present tense is colloquially the present tense form
    always used, while the simple present tense colloquially only is used as the
    habitual present tense. <br>
    e.g.: <i>Feachaim ar an teilifis i gcónaí = I always watch TV.</i></li>
  <li><b class="lightgreen">progressive in the habitual present tense:</b>
    <br>
    actions of a set duration, that one repeatedly/regularly does, <br>
    e.g.: <i>Bím ag feachaint ar an teilifís sa tráthnóna
    = I watch TV (normally) the (whole) afternoon.</i> <br>
    For short-term actions one uses the simple (habitual) present tense. <br>
    e.g.: <i>Feachaim ar an nuacht gach lá = I watch the news every day.</i></li>
</ul>
If the object should be a personal pronoun (e.g.: I'm building <i>it</i> right
now),the verbal noun is placed preceding a in the progressive instead of the appropriate
possessive pronoun, instead of <a href="ag.htm">ag</a> then the standard <a href="do.htm">do</a>.(do
+ a = <b class="red">á</b>) <br>

<h3>
<a name="relativ"></a><b class="lightgreen">relative form (an fhoirm choibhneasta)</b></h3>
These relative forms are <i>only </i> for analytic verb suffixes in the present
tense, habitual present tense and future in direct relative clauses. They have
the s-suffix in common (<i>-as/-eas</i> or <i>-fas/-feas</i>)
<p>
<table bgcolor="FFFFCC" border>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>present tense<br>(trad.)</b></td><td><b>present tense<br>(Connacht)</b></td><td><b>future</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1st conjug.</td><td class="red bold">-as/-eas</td><td class="red bold">-anns/-eanns</td><td class="red bold">-fas/-feas</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd conjug.</td><td class="red bold">-íos/-aíos</td><td class="red bold">-íonns/-aíonns</td><td class="red bold">-ós/-eos</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the present tense the form -as/-eas is the tradtional standard form. In
  Connacht, it fused with -ann/-eann zu -anns/-eanns. <br>
  In Ulster, both of the forms with -as/-eas als auch mit -anns/-eanns in the
  present tense are used.
<p>They are used if the antecedent is the <b>subject</b> of the relative clause,
  often also if it is the direct object. <br>
  <b>examples:</b>

<br>
  <i>&nbsp; an fear a ghlana(nn)s an carr = the man that cleans the car</i>.(present
  tense) <br>
  &nbsp; <i>an fear a cheannaío(nn)s an carr = the man that buys the car</i>.
  (present tense) <br>
  <i>&nbsp; an fear a ghlanfas an carr = the man who will clean the car</i>. (future)
  <br>
  &nbsp; <i>an fear a cheannós an carr = the man who will buy the car</i>.
  (future)
<p>It is (except in Munster) very common. <br>
  In the official standard, this form (with one exception) does not exist and
  is replaced with normal present tense-/future-verb forms: <br>
  &nbsp; <i>an fear a ghlanann an carr = the man that cleans the car</i>. (present
  tense) <br>
  &nbsp; <i>an fear a ghlanfaidh an carr = the man who will clean the car</i>.
  (future) <br>
  The exception is the verb "lean = follow" in the present tense (...a leanas
  = that follows). <br>
  &nbsp; <i>an t-alt a leanas = the article that follows</i>
<p>If the s- form is used or not, the 3rd person sg. is always used (also in other
  tenses), if the antecedent is the <b>subject</b> of the relative clause (as
  in German/ and sort of English). <br>
  &nbsp; <i>Is mise a scríobhann litir = I'm the one, that writes a letter.</i>
  (<u>nicht:</u> <i>*is mise a scríobhaim ...</i>!) <br>
  &nbsp; <i>Is mise a scríobha(nn)s litir = I'm the one, that writes a
  letter.</i> <br>
  &nbsp; <i>Is tusa a scríobhadh litir = You're the one, that normally
  wrote a letter</i><br>
  &nbsp; <i>Is sinne a scríobhfaidh litir = We're the ones that will write
  a letter </i> <br>
  &nbsp; <i>Is sinne a scríobhfas litir = We're the ones that will write
  a letter </i>
<p>Other (synthetic) verb suffixes can only occur if the antecedent is the <b>object</b>
  <br>
  <i>&nbsp; litir a scríobhaim = the letter that I write, <br>
  &nbsp; litir a scríobhaimid = the letter that we write, <br>
  &nbsp; litir a scríobhthá = the letter that you normally write,
  <br>
  &nbsp; litir a scríobhfaimid = the letter that we will write</i>)
<p>The relative form in the present tense of the irregularen verb <a href="bi.htm">bí</a>
  = be is <b class="red">atá</b>. <br>
  Similar to the old spelling <b class="red">adeir, adúirt</b>
  (today <i>a deir, a dúirt</i>) is the relative form of the verb <a href="abair.htm">abair</a>
  = say.
<p>The relative form of the copula is <b class="red">is</b> in
  the present tense or <b class="red">ba</b> (preceding a consonant),
  <b class="red">ab</b> (preceding a vowel and fh) in the preterite <br>

  <font size="-1"> In older grammar books(P.W. Joyce: A Grammar of the Irish Language,
  1922) all verbs are still divided into <i>simple</i> present tense (synthetic
  verb suffixes: <i>-im, -ir, -imid, -tí, -id</i> + older suffix of the
  3rd person sg. <i>-idh</i>) and <i>habitual</i> present tense (analytic suffix
  <i>-ann/eann</i> for alle persons): <br>
  simple present tense: <i>buailidh sé = he is hitting</i>, <br>
  habitual present tense: <i>buaileann sé = he hits(always)</i> <br>
  <br>
  Today, this difference is hardly ever encountered (except by irregular verbs):
  <br>
  The simple present tense: <i>deir sé = he says</i>, habitual present
  tense: <i>deireann sé = he says(always)</i> <br>
  Otherwise, the simple present tense and present tense-progressive fall into
  one in spoken Irish, while the suffix -ann expresses the habitual (and partially
  also the simple) present tense. </font>
