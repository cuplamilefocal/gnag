# Gramadach na Gaeilge

This is a clone of http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/ taken from https://web.archive.org/web/20220614061413if_/http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/gram.htm

As a temporary home, it can be browsed here: https://cuplamilefocal.github.io/gnag/
(probably best not to link to that yet)

## attribution

That was an English translation of the original German by Lars Br√§sicke; https://braesicke.de/gramadac.htm

"Translation into English courtesy of Lynn Schneider (all pages except: satz2.htm and satz4.htm, with the kind help of Daniel Nieciecki)"

The English version was for a long time hosted by Amy of http://nualeargais.ie/, this clone was prompted by that being taken offline.

I have asked Lars for permission to continue the translation, but have not heard back yet!


## Goals

 - incorporate the German text in a parallel fashion
 - clean up HTML (css rather than <font>)
 - convert to markdown (maybe?)
 - ~publish on github~
 - accept corrections and expansions
