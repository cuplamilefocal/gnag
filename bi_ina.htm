<br>
Classificatory clauses (e.g. "The man is a doctor ")&nbsp; are usually formed with the <a href="kopul5.htm">copula</a>: (Is docht&uacute;ir &eacute; an fear).
<br>
Often, one needs clause forms with the verb <a href="bi.htm">b&iacute;</a> instead,
partially to express the time relevance ("I was a student at that time "), the attainment ("then I became a teacher ")  or also just to vary things a bit.
In some dialects, these cluase forms are generally preferred over copular clauses.

<h3><a name="bin"><font color="#009900">classificatory clauses with <i>b&iacute;</i> and der preposition <i>i (= in)</i></font></a></h3>

<p>The use of the preposition <a href="i.htm">i = in</a> is easily explained. Because it is a condition that is being described, <b>in</b> which one finds oneself or a function that one has with "<b>in</b>" (= in oneself).
<p>Here, there are  3 clause forms:
<p><b>1. i + possessive pronoun + predicate:</b>

<p><b><i>T&aacute;</i></b> m&eacute; <b><i>i mo</i></b> dhocht&uacute;ir. = I am a doctor. ("I am in my (status as) a doctor")
<br>
<b><i>T&aacute;</i></b> Br&iacute;d <b><i>ina</i></b> docht&uacute;ir. = Br&iacute;d is a doctor. ("Br&iacute;d is in-her (function as) a doctor")

<p><b>2. within a relative clause (i + subject):</b>
<p>Docht&uacute;ir <b><i>at&aacute; ionam.</i></b> = I am a doctor. ("a doctor, that is in-me", meaning: "...whose function is  in me")
<br>
Docht&uacute;ir <b><i>at&aacute; ann.</i></b> = He is a doctor. ("a doctor, that is in-him", "...whose function is in him")
<br>
Docht&uacute;ir <b><i>at&aacute; in Br&iacute;d.</i></b> = Br&iacute;d is a doctor ("a doctor, that is in Br&iacute;d", "... whose function is in Br&iacute;d")

<p>Note the use of <i>in</i> (instead of i) here preceding names and the missing eclipsis.
(<i>in Br&iacute;d</i> instead of <i>i mBr&iacute;d</i>).
<br>
In some grammar explanations, the use of the prepositional pronoun (e.g. <i>ionam</i>) is seen as allowed.
<br>
Furthermore, one should note the double meaning of <i>"Docht&uacute;ir at&aacute; ann"</i>: <i>"He is a doctor"</i> and <i>"There is a doctor "</i> (due to the common adverbial use of ann = da: <i>t&aacute; .. ann = "there is"</i>)

<p><b>3. in an "only"-clause (i + subject):</b>
<p>N&iacute;l <b><i>ionam ach</i></b> amad&aacute;n = I am only an idiot (lit.: not-is in-me but an idiot)
<br>
<br>
Only an "only"-clause is considerable as a non-relative clause form.
<br>
A normal non-relative clause with <i>i + subject</i>, like e.g.: *<i>T&aacute; amad&aacute;n ionam</i> is not possible!
<br>
Here, one could only do so as the form <i>T&aacute; m&eacute; i m'amad&aacute;n = I am an idiot </i> (see 1.) <br>
<br><b>use:</b>
<br>
These forms are used,
<ul>
<li>if a <b><i>recently attained </i></b> or <b><i>temporary</i> function, profession or similar </b> is meant.
<br>
e.g.: <i>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; f&oacute;s i mo chail&iacute;n beag ag an am sin = I was still a little girl at that time </i>
<br>
If the connection of subject and predicate is already inborn, and this (permanent) connection cannot be reversed,  one <i>cannot</i> use these expressions, then it is only possible as a  copular clause:
<br>
(incorrect e.g. *<i>T&aacute; an brad&aacute;n ina iasc</i> instead of correct: <i>Is iasc &eacute; an brad&aacute;n</i> <i>= The salmon is a fish</i>, because the salmon was always a fish and will always remain one, it's not just temporarily taking on the job of a fish)</li>
<li>in <b><i>tenses</i> where there is <i>no copular form</i></b>, so, in the future, imperative, as well as in clauses requiring a verbal noun. Most of the time these sentences are logically equivalent to the first point. e.g.:
<br>
<i>B&iacute; i d'fhear! = Be a man! (lit.: "be in your man")</i>, <br>
<i>N&iacute; maith l&eacute;i bheith ina cail&iacute;n beag. = She doesn't like being  a little girl. (lit.: "not-is good with-her being in-her girl small ")</i>
<br>
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="klassar"><font color="#009900">classificatory clause with <i>b&iacute;</i> and the preposition <i>ar (= on)</i></font></a></h3>

<p>This expression is used especially in those cases when <i>"one of...", </i> and the like should be expressed  with the superlative. It is also used for statements like <i>"one so ... as ... "</i> (i.e. as the attributive equative). e.g.:

<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; <b><i>ar na daoine is m&oacute;</i></b> sa rang = He is <b><i>one of the biggest</i></b> in the class.(lit.: "is he on the people are biggest in the class ")
<br>
T&aacute; s&iacute; <b><i>ar na cail&iacute;n&iacute; is &aacute;ille</i></b> ar an domhan = She is <b><i>one of the most beautiful </i></b>girls in the world. (lit.: "is she on the girls are most beautiful on the world ")
<br>
T&aacute; s&eacute; <b><i>ar fhear chomh maith leat</i></b> = He is <i><b>a man as good as you</b></i>.
<br>
T&aacute; sin <b><i>ar ceann de na ruda&iacute;</i></b> a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; = That is <b><i>one of the things </i></b> of which I spoke.(lit.: "is that on head of the things that spoke I")
<h3><a name="idar"><font color="#009900">identificatory clauses with <i>b&iacute;</i> and the preposition <i>ar (= on)</i></font></a></h3>

<p>These are mostly used to demonstrate  the superlative ("the smartest " etc.) and with ordinal numbers ("the first ", "the second ", etc.).

<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; <b><i>ar an bhfear is cliste</i></b> sa bhaile = He is <b><i>the smartest man</i></b> in the town. (lit.: "is he on the man is smartest in-the town ")
<br>
T&aacute; s&iacute; <b><i>ar an gcail&iacute;n is &aacute;ille</i></b> in &Eacute;irinn = She is <b><i>the most beautiful girl</i></b> in Ireland (lit.: "is she on the girl is most beautiful in Ireland")
<br>
Bh&iacute; s&eacute; <b><i>ar an dara fear</i></b> a th&aacute;inig = He was <b><i>the second man</i></b> that came (lit.: "was he on the second man that came ")
