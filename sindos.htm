<h2 id="oben"><i class="lightgreen">Causes of Initial Mutations in Irish </i></h2>

The main  cause  is the Irish way of speaking: the words of a sentence are pulled together and spoken <b>without a pause</b>. Pauses are almost always avoided, and some sentences seem so as if spoken as a single word. (there seems to be a quasi <i>"horror vacui"</i> = a fear of nothingness.)
<br>
The individual words affect each other in pronunciation (what is generally known as <b>"Sandhi"</b>), similar as it occurs in French  (called there "liaison" , comp.: <i>le<u>s</u> amis [le<u>z</u>ami]</i>), in order to enable this unhindered flow of speech.<br>
On the other hand, in German there is a short pause made after almost every word so that the beginnings and ends of the words remain seperate and unchanged. It's important to note that those words in German beginning in a vowel actually don't begin with a vowel sound but a glottal stop, which is not the case in Irish.
<br>
Another thing: Similar to the French, certain unspoken phonemes "reappear" under certain circumstances (e.g. the most often mute <i>s</i> in <i>les</i>). But as opposed to French, in Irish, these letters are mostly no longer included in the spelling. They make themselves known via the "t-, h-, n-prefix", "eclipsis" or similar phenomena.
<br>
Also different than French are these changes to the beginnings of words to their own right, and being used to express grammatical relationships to other words.

<h3>
<span class="red">lenition</span></h3>

These mutations eased the flow of speech because through it, the obstacles presented by the stop sounds disappeared. Stops cause a stop in the flow of air, and in turn hinder the flow of speech.
<br>
The cause of <a href="lenition.htm">lenition</a> was generally in Early Irish the <b>position of the consonant between two vowels</b>, as well as within the word as over the word "limits."
<br>
If the word ended in a vowel and the next began in a  consonant + vowel (which was mostly the case), this  consonant was now between 2 vowels and was lenited.
<br>
Today the once final vowels have been mostly discarded, but lenition became in time a  tool of grammar, being then used where once a vowel suffix once stood.
<br>
For
<b>example</b>:&nbsp; the feminine article was originally longer and ended in the vowel -a (*<span class="lightgreen"><i><b>sinda</b></i></span>). In time, it was shortened to <i>an</i>, but the following lenition was retained. This explains  lenition of feminine nouns after the article.
<br>
The masculine article (*<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindos</i></b></span>) was  *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindi</i></b></span> in the genitive singular and thus incurred lenition.
<br>
The masculine possessive pronoun <b>a</b> is an old genitive singular of the personal pronoun. Just like the genitive singular of the masc. articles,  lenition is also required afterwards.
<br>
Feminine nouns once ended in the nominative preferably in the vowel -a (as is the case in  Latin), this is why the following adjectives and nouns in the genitive are still lenited today (while the lenition today is generalised and also occurs following those feminine nouns, which didn't once end in -a).

<h3>
<span class="red">eclipsis and n-prefix</span></h3>
<a href="eklipse.htm">eclipsis</a> and the <a href="thnd.htm#n">n-prefix</a> occur where today or once the <b>preceding word ended in a nasal</b> (m, n, ng, mostly n).
<br>
So were the endings of e.g. <b>numbers</b> <i>seacht = seven, naoi = nine </i> and <i>deich = ten </i> earlier surely in a nasal (comp. Latin <i>septe<u>m</u>, nove<u>m</u>, dece<u>m</u></i>).
This -m is long since erased from  Irish; but it lives on in the modern eclipsis. (e.g. <i>seacht mbád = seven boats </i>). After <i>ocht = eight </i> is also, in analogy to 7,9,10  eclipsed, although the number 8 never ended in a nasal.
<br>
Because the preposition "i" once, as in German, was written "in", thus ending in a nasal, explains its following eclipsis. On the other hand, the eclipsis also made the -n in "in" superfluous, so that the preposition is today whittled down to "i".
<br>
It is easy to understand that the conjunction <i>go</i> (also today a rare preposition in the sense of "with") causes eclipsis when one views the originally related Latin counterpart <i>cum</i>. Also <i>go</i> (Old Irish <i>co</i>) ended once in a nasal.
<br>
Eclipsis was produced by these final nasals as a way of simplifying speech. A voiceless consonant is difficult to speak after -m or -n, and so it was simply re-voiced ( e.g. p to b, t to d), because -mb- and -nd- are easier to speak than -mp- and -nt-. In time, many of the end nasals disappeared but the initial mutation remained and was then generalised as a grammatical tool (e.g. also stretched on other words, e.g. <i>ocht = eight</i>).
<p>After <b>preposition + article</b>,  either eclipsis or lenition can occur, depending on the dialect. Why?: The original accusative singular form of the articles were *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindon</i></b></span> (masc.) and *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindan</i></b></span> (fem.). It endes then with an -n as a nasal, and this is why today eclipsis follows: ar an mbord = on the table.
<br>
Just as in German, there was the possibility of  the accusative or the dative after certain prepositions (depending on the desired meaning: motion or position, in German e.g.: <i>auf dem Tisch</i> and <i>auf den Tisch</i>). The dative form of the article was now *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindu</i></b></span> (masc.) or *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sinda</i></b></span> (fem.), which of course caused  lenition  (this is why in Ulster today still following preposition and article  lenition is always used).
<br>
Today this lexical differentiation between dative and accusative following a preposition no longer is used. After  most prepositions now follows always the dative or what remains of it. If  lenition or eclipsis is used, is now more a question of dialect (Connacht/Munster: <i>ar an mbord = on(to) the table </i>, Ulster: <i>ar an bhord = on(to) the table </i>)
<p>In the <b>genitive plural</b>, the article once was also *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindan</i></b></span>, from which eclipsis resulted.
<br>
The plural possessive pronouns <b>ár, bhur, a</b> are old genitive plural forms of the personal pronoun, probably ended in a  nasal as well and therefore still cause eclipsis today.
<h3 class="red">t-prefix</h3>

The <a href="thnd.htm#t">t-prefix</a> is the <b>remains of the  -d- of the article</b>, which is otherwise unseen.
<br>
As was mentioned by lenition, the article in earlier times was quite a bit longer.
<br>
The masculine article used to be *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindos</i></b></span>. [ <a href="#fn1" id="fnverweis1">1</a> ] This was shortened over time to the modern&nbsp; <i>an</i>.
<br>
The suffix -os was lost before consonants, also the -d- fell out as "superfluous"  (better said: -nd melted into -n) Preceding a vowel, the suffix -os was lenited, spoken as [oh]  and lenthened the lifespan of the (post the omission of the -o-) leading d, in which it hardened the -d- to -t (sindos &gt; sindoh &gt; sindh &gt; sint)
<br>
The -d in *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindos</i></b></span> thus remained longer preceding vowels  (*<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sind</i></b></span>) and become unvoiced ("t"), so approximately *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sint</i></b></span>, it lost additionally its s (<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>int</i></b></span>). Today this is written a bit differently (<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>an t-</i></b></span>, e.g.: <i>an t-ull = the apple </i>).
<br>
The feminine article ended in a (*<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sinda</i></b></span>). A following word with s was lenited to sh, spoken [h]  (e.g. *<i>sinda shulis</i>). Later on, the a was also dropped. The d of the article was devoiced through the  [h] to t, the [h] itself became mute (*<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sint'</i></b></span> shulis &gt; *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>int'</i></b></span> shulis) Today, one says and writes this as <i>an tsúil = the eye.</i>

<h3>
<span class="red">h-prefix</span></h3>
Today one can explain the <a href="thnd.htm#h">h-prefix</a> as a "pronunciation help between two vowels "  and it is also used in this way.
<br>
Actually it is quite often the <b>lenited final -s</b> of the preceding word, which is no longer to be seen. (lenited s becomes a spoken [h]).
<br>
As in the other Indoeuropean languages, endings in  -s were once very prevalent (comp. the Latin suffix -us, Greek -os, Lithuanian -as, Old Celtic -os)
<br>
e.g. the possessive pronoun of the 3rd person sg. fem. <i>a = her: </i>It was once *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>esjas</i></b></span>, whose s between vowels became lenited to [h]. This is why  there is today an h-prefix preceding a vowel after <i>a = her.</i>
<br>
Similarly, the feminine article in the genitive singular ended in -s (*<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindas</i></b></span>), so that also here an h-prefix follows.
<br>
The (feminine) nominative plural article <i>na</i> was once also *<b><i class="lightgreen">sindas</i></b>.
<br>
<font size="-1">
<br>
The masculine nominative article was then *<span class="lightgreen"><b><i>sindos</i></b></span>, but this suffix -os was probably weaker in its vowel and had another effect: the leniting final -s made the  -d , after the devoicing of -o- , voiceless to -t, so that the <i>t-prefix</i> preceding a vowel remained (sindos &gt; sindoh &gt; sind-h &gt; sint &gt; an t-)

[ <a href="#fnverweis1" id="fn1">1</a> ] The similarity of <i>sindos</i> to the modern  demonstrative pronoun <i>sin</i> is not coincidental.
<br>
Also in German, article and demonstrative pronoun stem from one source.
<br>
(comp. by: <i>das Haus</i> the word "das" could be the article or a demonstrative pronoun ["= that house "]. In the sentence: <i>Das ist ein Haus</i> , the "das" is always the demonstrative pronoun)</font>
