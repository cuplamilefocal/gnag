<hr>

<p>In Irish there are 2 words, which can be translated into English with <i><b>"to be "</b></i>.
<br>
While the copula "<i>is</i>"only serves to conjoin subject and predicate, the verb <a href="bi.htm">b&iacute;</a> is <i>predicative itself </i>:
<p><b>B&iacute;</b> expresses an  action of <b>existance</b> is a (named or unnamed) <i>state of being</i>: T&aacute;im = I am (I exist, there is a &quot;me&quot;). It is then a verb of the <i>state of being</i>, of <i>existance.</i>
<br>
This is why it is mostly used  with prepositions of location, in simplest form with <a href="i.htm">i (= in)</a> or its 3rd person masculine conjugation <b>ann</b> (= in him/in it/therein, extended "there/here"). (comp. a state of being <i>in which </i> one is) e.g.: <i>T&aacute; daoine ann = People exist / There are people here.</i>
<br>
<b>Existance</b> alone may by freely expressed without an <i>i/ ann</i> , e.g. <i>N&iacute;l aon Dia ach t&uacute; = There is no God aside from you.</i>
<p>Also other states/conditions can be described (e.g. the state of being of standing, sitting, living  (see <a href="verbnom1.htm#VerlZustand">state of being verbs</a>), the state of being in a profession/practicing a trade, etc.). Furthermore, it is used with predicative adjectives.
<p><b>Examples</b>:
<br>
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ann</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is here/ he exists </td>
<td nowrap>"is he in-it"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; sa teach</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is in the house </td>
<td nowrap>"is he [in his being] in-the house "</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ar an mbord</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is on the table </td>
<td nowrap>"is he [in his being] on the table "</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina sheasamh </i></td>
<td nowrap>He is standing</td>
<td nowrap>"is he in-his [state of being of] standing"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina ch&oacute;na&iacute;</i></td>
<td nowrap>He lives </td>
<td nowrap>"is he in-his [state of being of] living[somewhere]"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina dhocht&uacute;ir</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is/works as a doctor</td>
<td nowrap>"is he in-his [state of being of] [being]a doctor"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina l&aacute;</i></td>
<td nowrap>It is daytime </td>
<td nowrap>"is he in-his [state of being of] [being]day"</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; m&oacute;r</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is big </td>
<td nowrap>"is he [in a state of being of] [being]large"</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This existance/state of being/location description is the base meaning of <i>b&iacute;</i>.
<br>
The extent of existance or the <b>magnitude</b> is expressed without a preposition. i.e. statistics such as height, weight, age, time and the like is done by usgin b&iacute; + magnitude:
<br>
e.g.: <i>T&aacute; s&iacute; seacht mbliana d'aois = She is 7 years old; T&aacute; s&iacute; naoi gcloch me&aacute;chain = She is 9 stones (=57 kg) heavy; T&aacute; s&eacute; ceathr&uacute; chun a tr&iacute; = It is quarter to three.</i>
<p>The modern uses as the <b>auxilliary verb </b> (e.g. in the <a href="verbnom1.htm#Verlaufsform">progressive</a>) are secondary, but more or less contain the sense of a temporally limited <i>state of being</i>. In the progressive, the temporal limitation (to that moment) is especially emphasized.
<br>
<i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ag &oacute;l = He is drinking (right now at this moment)</i>
<p><b>Predicative adjectives </b> are mostly used with <b>b&iacute;</b> today, and the temporal limitation moves into the backgound, because a  state of being is being described.
<br>
Because <i>b&iacute;</i> itself is predicative, its use as a predicative adjective is grammatically problematic, and earlier it was only considered possible to make the adjectives into adverbs  (with <b>go</b>). This has remained so only by a few subjective adjectives of assessment (<i>T&aacute; s&eacute; go dona = It is bad </i>). Otherwise,  predicative adjectives are used today (or it's the case that they are indeed adverbs, whereby go is omitted): <i>T&aacute; s&eacute; m&oacute;r = He is big </i>
<br>
The
<b>copula</b> can also (less common today, earlier always) be used with adjectives. Today, this is limited to a certain few expressions. In this case, all signs of a temporal limitation are lacking, and it is moreso the permanent intrinsic quality being described. All in all, the differenced in meaning between <i>b&iacute;</i> and <i>is</i> with adjectives is rather small. The copular clause emphasizes more the adjective, and is therefore often interjectory ("He is <em>big</em>!")
<p>
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tr>
<td><b>with the copula</b></td>
<td nowrap><i>Is m&oacute;r &eacute;</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is big!</td>
<td nowrap>"is big he "</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>with b&iacute;</b></td>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; m&oacute;r</i></td>
<td nowrap>He is big </td>
<td nowrap>"is he [in a state of being of] [being]big"</td>
</tr></table>

<p>With the  construction <b><i>i + possessive pronoun + noun</i></b> , <i>b&iacute;</i> can form a clause with a similar meaning as that with the copula. (see <a href="bi_ina.htm">classifications- and identification clauses without the copula</a>)
<br>
So, instead of an actual classification/identification (with the copula), there follows a description of a state of being  (with b&iacute;). e.g.:
<p>
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tr>
<td width="18%" nowrap><b>with the copula</b></td>
<td width="22%" nowrap><i>Is docht&uacute;ir &eacute;</i></td>
<td width="13%" nowrap>he is a doctor </td>
<td width="47%" nowrap>"is doctor he "</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>with b&iacute;</b></td>
<td nowrap><i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina dhocht&uacute;ir</i></td>
<td nowrap>he is a doctor </td>
<td nowrap>"is he in his [state of being of] a [being]doctor"</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The copular clause gives a rather <i>(mostly permanent) assigment</i> "he = doctor ", while the clause with <i>b&iacute;</i> shows that a <i>(mostly temporary) relationship </i> exists, which was just achieved or could be reversed, and therefore is more a state of being  (he is now a doctor, he works as a doctor, but will not always do so)
<br>
e.g. <i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina fhear anois = Now he is a man </i> (lit.: "is he in-his [state of being of] [being]a man now ". Because before that he was a child)
<br>
With the use of finite temporal  adverbs, e.g. <i>anois = now </i>, the construction with the copula also becomes possible, e.g. <i>Is fear &eacute; anois = Now, he is a man </i>), as well as the use of <i>b&iacute;</i> with infinite temporal adverbs, e.g.: <i>Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina amad&aacute;in riamh = He has always been an idiot.</i> Through this, the above statement receives a permanent vs. temporal relativity. The main difference of the sentences is the  very classification through the copula, where <i>b&iacute;</i> states that it's a case of  state of being being described.
<br>
e.g.: <i>Is fear &eacute; = He is a man </i>: He is classified as a man.
<br>
e.g.: <i>T&aacute; s&eacute; ina fhear = He is a man </i>: He is in a state of being, in which he posesses the qualities of a man.
<p>Different words for "being", and special copulae exist  in other languages as well: e.g. in Spanish "estar" and "es"
<br>
(notice the non-coincidental similarity between "t&aacute;" and "es<u>ta</u>r" as well as between "is" and "es"!)
<br>
The form <i>t&aacute;</i> derives from the  indoeurop. root <i>staro</i> = to stand to (underlining the verbal base meaning as the German &quot;Zu-standes")
