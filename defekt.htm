<p>Defect  verbs are those verbs that cannot be fully conjugated, and therefore are only present in a few forms. Partially, some of them will only appear in one form.

<p><i>feadair</i> is conjugated as before in the passive (in the plural, similar to the modern preterite), but it has an active meaning. It is the only remaining


 verba deponentia

 in Irish. It is temporally independent (<i>feadramar = we know, we knew </i>)
<br>
<i>Feadair</i> is today only used in interrogative constructs (<i>an bhfeadair tú? = do you know?</i>) or in negative statements (<i>ní fheadar = I don't know, I wonder </i>).
<br>
It fuses often with <i>ní</i> to become <i>n'fheadar</i>.
<br>
<i>N'fheadar an bhfuil sé ann fós = I wonder if it's still there</i>
<br>
Paired with <i>do</i> it takes on the meaning "to be able to tell someone " ("to let someone know "):
<br>
<i>An bhfeadraís seo dom? = Could you let me know it?</i>

The forms without -r- (feadamar, etc.) deomnstrate the forms of classical Irish, the later -r- shows the taking on of the -r- of the singular forms, which is no longer considered a part of the suffix, but is counted as part of the stem.
</font>
<p>Today, feadair is rather seldomly used mostly still in Munster.  The noun and old verbal noun <i>fios = knowledge </i> is much more common (<i>Níl a fhios agam = I don't know </i>, lit. "not-is its knowledge at-me").
<br>
In Connemara, there is a verb <i>ní</i> in the meaning of "to ask oneself"  (<i>Ní mé = I wonder </i>).

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">

<a name="ar"><i><font color="#009900">ar, arsa = say </font></i></a></h2>
</td>

<p><i>Ar, arsa</i> is only used <i>after </i> <b>direct speech</b>. It is also temporally independent (<i>arsa mise = I said, I say </i>).
<br>
<font color="FF0000"><b>Ar</b></font> only precedes pronouns of the third person (<i>seisean, sise, siadsan</i>).
<br>
<font color="FF0000"><b>Arsa</b></font> is used in all other cases (preceding an article, but very seldom and archaic also <i>ars</i>)
<br>
With
<i>Ar, arsa</i> one may only use the emphatic forms of the pronouns (<i>mise, tusa, seisean, sise, sinne, sibhse, siadsan</i>)
<p><i>"Tuigim anois", arsa Seán = "Now I understand&quot;, said Seán.</i>
<br>
<i>"Ní thuigeann tú ar chor ar bith", ar sise = "You don't understand a thing ", she said </i>
<p>In <a href="indir.htm">indirect speech</a>, another verb must be used (e.g. <i>abair = say </i>):
<br>
<i>Dúirt sé léi gur thuig sé = he told her that he understood.</i>
<br>
<i>Dúirt sí leis nár thuig sé ar chor ar bith = she told him that he didn't understand a thing.</i>
<p>
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tr>

<h2>
<a name="dar"><i><font color="#009900">dar = appear </font></i></a></h2>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This verb exists only in one form: <i>dar = (it) appears </i>. It is also temporally independent.
<br>
It is always used in combination with the preposition <i>le = with </i> : <i>dar liom = it appears to me (I think, thought, etc. lit.: "(it) appears with-me")</i>.
<br>
<i>Dar leis an bhfear go bhfuil sé ann = it appears/appeared to the man, that he was there / the man thought that he was there </i>

<a name="dobair"><i><font color="#009900">dóbair = almost happen </font></i></a></h2>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Variations: <i>d'fhóbair</i>, <i>hóbair</i>.
<br>
This verb appears also only on one form (3rd person singular preterite).
<br>
Although its origin is a verb, it now has taken on the meaning of an adverb ("almost", "nearly").
<br>
<i>Dóbair dom titim = dóbair go dtitfinn = I almost fell </i>
<p></p>

<p>With good cause, the <a href="kopul1.htm">copula</a> is seen as a defect verb.
<br>
Because its description would be to involved to be included here, it has its own chapter in the above link.
