  <h1><a name="suas"><span class="lightgreen">About the Irish Language</span></a></h1>
</center>

<hr width="50%" style="color:red;">
<p>To visitors to Ireland, Irish comes to one's attention most often via seemingly
  indecipherable words on signs and maps. <br>
  ander or next to the word <i>Dublin</i> stands some <i>Baile Átha Cliath
  </i>(spoken blah cleea or bailyah cleea ). The former <i>Kingston</i> exists
  in the Republic of Ireland but now as <i>Dún Laoghaire</i> (spoken doon
  leera), <i>Limerick</i> called in Irish <i>Luimneach</i> (spoken leemrehkh).
  The entire country is called <i>Éire</i> (spoken eareh) or in the long
  form <i>Poblacht na hÉireann </i>(spoken poblekht ne hairen) <br>
  It is often, even in Dublin, substantially easier to reach the city centre when
  you know that the same is called <i>an Lár</i> in Irish. <br>
  It may also come to a few silly misanderstandings at the doors to public toilets:
  an "M" means <i>mná = ladies </i>(spoken mrah or menah), whereas an "F"
  stands for <i>fir = men!</i> <br>
  From these points, it already becomes clear that Irish is rather not an english
  dialect, but something completely different.
<h3> <b class="red">The Relationships Between the Languages</b></h3>

Irish is only distantly related to German or English. <br>
All 3 belong to the <b class="lightgreen">indo-european languages</b>.
This is, mind you, a very large language family which spans from Iceland to Ceylon.
Among those counted are the germanic, celtic, slavic, baltic, romance, northern
indian, iranian, greek, armenian, albanian and many other languages.(nearly <i>all</i>
european languages <i>except</i> Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Basque and Turkish)
<br>
German and English are- not surprisingly- part of the <i>germanic branch</i> ,
while Irish is a c<i>eltic</i> language.
<p>The <b class="lightgreen">Celtic Languages</b> are roughly divided
  into 2 main groups, the <b><i>Insular Celtic</i></b> and the <b><i>Mainland Celtic</i></b>.
  The latter became extinct already in the time of the Roman Empire. It was to
  this group that languages such as Gaulish belonged. <br>
  <b class="lightgreen">Insular Celtic</b> lived on due to a lack of
  extensive Roman influence. <br>
  A second division is made: the <b class="lightgreen">Goidelic</b>
  ("q-celtic", modern Gaelic) and the <b class="lightgreen">Bretonic</b>
  ("p-celtic" or Brythonic)<a name="fnverweis1">[</a> <a href="#fn1">1</a> ].
  <br>
  To the Brythonic belong: modern Welsh [<b class="lightgreen">Cymraeg</b>]
  in Wales, Breton [<b class="lightgreen">Brezhoneg</b>] in Bretagne(Brittany)
  and the unfortunately extinct Cornish [<b class="lightgreen">Kernewek</b>]
  in Cornwall (which is being revived with astonishing sucess). <br>
  Even Breton is, in a sense, an "insular celtic" language, because their people
  settled over from Britannia in the early Middle Ages to the Mainland.
<h3> <b class="red">Languages in Ireland</b></h3>

<p>The majority of Irish people speak not <b class="lightgreen">Irish</b>
  but <b class="lightgreen">English</b> in everyday life. The Irish
  English (Hiberno-English) differs through the Irish accent and smaller further
  influences of Irish Gaelic. There is virtually no Irishman who isn't well versed
  in English, but inversely considerably many who can't speak Irish. <br>
  Aside from thses two most important languages there is also <b class="lightgreen">Shelta
  (Traveller Cant, Sheldru)</b>, the language of the Irish Travellers.
  It bases in the vocabulary of Irish, is technically also a celtic language and
  is used by approx. 6000 people in Ireland (outside of Ireland by 80000 emigrants).
  <br>
  In Ulster (Northern Ireland and Donegal) <b class="lightgreen">Scots (Lallans)</b>,
  thanks to the Scottish settlers of the 17th C, is also spoken, and the Irish
  variant is called <b class="lightgreen">Ullans (Ulster Lallans)</b>.
  <br>
  <b class="lightgreen">Scottish Gaelic</b> is, however, not spoken
  in Ireland. Although, some constructs of Ulster Irish come close to the Scottish
  Gaelic through Scottish immigrants (e.g. in Antrim). On the Isle of Rathlin,
  after a resettling of the island, more Scottish Gaels than any other group,
  so that their dialect was Scottish Gaelic, though this is no longer active since
  the end of the 19th Century.
<h3> <span class="red">Gaelic</span> </h3>

<b class="lightgreen">Gaelic</b> (Goidelic) was originally only spoken
in Ireland. It spread out over to the Isle of Man and Scotland, where once the
Picts lives (a partly pre-celtic, partly celtic people about whose language(s)
is not much known). <br>
From this there are today three languages: Irish Gaelic [<b class="lightgreen">Gaeilge</b>],
Scottish Gaelic [<b class="lightgreen">Gàidhlig</b>] and Manx
Gaelic [<b class="lightgreen">Gaelg</b>]. These 3 split first in the
Middle Ages and have remained quite similar, and there is generally no need for
additional translation for an understanding(it is comparable to the similarity
between German and Dutch). <br>
The Gaelic languages all shared ultimately the same fate, namely the gradual displacement
by English, for the larger England attained the rule over the British Isles and
kept this until well into the 20th Century. Gaelic had no place therein, and was
banned out of public life, the schools, the courts etc.. Since the early 17th
Cent., the flight of the last of the Gaelic Princes from Ulster, there had been
no Irish speaking upper class. The following aristocrats were mostly immigrants
from England with land claims. In the post-1830 instituted schools, it was all
but explicitly forbidden to speak Gaelic, and it was certainly frowned upon. The
famine from 1845-48 in Ireland and the following waves of emigration which most
greatly impacted the poor, Gaelic-speaking rural population, led finally up to
a virtual extinction of the language in the 19th Century, although in the beginning
of the 19th Cent. there were still large parts of Ireland that remained Irish-speaking.
Those who wanted to emigrate, had to be able to speak English and those who wanted
to stay even moreso, so that Irish-speaking parents adopted the slogan "Keep Irish
from the children" . Also not to be ignored is the role of the Catholic Church,
which was rather more interested in English-speaking (and therewith better adaptable
for missionary work) members. In addition, the Irish Nation defined itself less
through its ethnic roots as through its Catholic confession, so there was no need
for the Gaelic language in order to separate themselves from the English. It was
first later, at the end of the 19th Century, that the interest in Celtic culture
and language reawakened, and by then the majority of the population was already
English-speaking. <br>
Only in remote areas, in which "the Empire" had no great interest, remained untouched.
It is for this reason that language-isolated areas developed. These lie far apart
from one another, and are today called "Gaeltachts". <br>
One cannot say that the Irish are to be held accountable for "all too willingly"
giving up their language; it is rather remarkable, that Irish managed to survive.
<p>
<br>
  Today there are 3 main dialects (canúintí) of Irish <a name="fnverweis2">[</a>
  <a href="#fn2">2</a> ], namely that of Munster [<b class="lightgreen">Gaolainn/Gaeilge
  na Mumhan</b>], Connacht [<b class="lightgreen">Gaeilge Connacht</b>]
  and Ulster [<b class="lightgreen">Gaeilig/Gaeilge Uladh</b>], which
  are again then split into their respective sub-divisions. The differences are
  much smaller than, say, those between Plattdeutsch and Bavarian. Ulster-Gaelic
  (only spoken now in Donegal, Dún na nGall or Tír Chonnail) is,
  in fact, quite similar to Scottish Gaelic. <br>
  Due to a lack of native speakers, Leinster (Cúige Laighean) has no own
  dialect anymore. Most Irish speakers found there today are that of the <b class="lightgreen">Lárchanúint</b>
  ("central dialect"), an artificially created dialect, especially in Dublin (Baile
  Átha Cliath).The Lárchanúint and its pronunciation is based
  heavily on the modern spellings and in the standardised grammar. In some areas
  of County Meath (Contae na Mí) live some immigrant native speakers from
  Connacht, carrying on the specialities of that particular dialect. Because of
  these dialectical differences, a so-called official standard grammar[<b class="lightgreen">an
  Caighdeán Oifigiúil</b>] has been developed, especially
  for official matters. It is also being attempted to push this standard up against
  the dialects in order to unify the language. <br>
  There is not a great difference (e.g. in Welsh) between oral and written Irish,
  in view of the grammar or vocabulary.
<h3><b class="red">History of Irish</b></h3>

<p>The Celts came to Ireland around 500 BC and mingled with the native (pre-indoeuropean)
  people. Due to a lack of written history, not much is able to be said about
  Goidelic, the language of those early Celts. From the time period from around
  500 - 700 AD there are a few inscriptions in <b class="lightgreen">Ogham-Script</b>,
  these are however not very numerous and contain mainly names. The language recorded
  in this form is known as <b class="lightgreen">Archaic Irish (an Ghaeilge
  Ársa)</b>. <br>
  First with the Christianisation, are the earliest manuscripts to be found (in
  latin script). This form of speech, <b class="lightgreen">Old Irish (an tSean-Ghaeilge)</b>
  was used from approx. 700-900. This was the "golden age" of Ireland, the time
  of closters and high culture, while outside of Ireland a rather culturally dark
  epoch after the period migration reigned. Irish was one of the first european
  languages, in which, next to Latin and Greek, a noteworthy amount of literature
  was created. <br>
  This cultural blossoming ended with the invasion of the Vikings; also the Irish
  language was hit hard by this downfall, what also led to a simplification in
  the(beforehand very komplicated) rules governing inflexion. Only a few Scandinavian
  words were incorporated (e.g.: <i>fuinneog = "windeye" = window</i>). This epoch
  is called the <b><span class="lightgreen">Middle </span><span class="lightgreen">Irish
  (an Mheán-Ghaeilge)</span></b>and took place between 900-1200. <br>
  Following the Norman invasion it came to yet another 1200-1600 blossoming of
  Gaelic culture, so that the immigrant Normans were actually assimilated and
  even took on the Irish language (as one used to say: "Hiberniores Hibernicis
  ipsis = Irisher as the Irish themseves"). Many words of the Norman French were
  taken up (e.g.: <i>garsún = boy</i>). The <b class="lightgreen">Early
  Modern Irish</b> or <b class="lightgreen">Classical Irish (an Ghaeilge
  Chlasaiceach)</b> used at this time was the unified literary norm in
  all of Ireland and Scotland. <br>
  We speak of Mornem Irish or <b class="lightgreen">Modern Irish (an Nua-Ghaeilge)</b>
  from 1600 on, as the Classical Irish faded out of use. It split itself off from
  Scottish Gaelic completely and reduced its previous higher status to assume
  that of a strictly rural language. <br>
  With the victories of Cromwell and and the following importation of Protestants,
  and the revoking of the power of the last of the Gaelic aristocracy in the 17th
  Century. also the unity of Classical Irish disappeared. The dialectical differences
  that had existed beforehand now greatened and dominated the language and the
  literary tradition crumbled completely. First again in the 19th Century awoke
  interest in the language anew, and with it a new literature. The defenders of
  the Irish vernacular triumphed against Traditionalists, who intended to revive
  the Classical Irish. Despite this, traditional and antiquated forms remained
  in both grammar and spelling. A spelling reform was first to be a success in
  1945.

<h3 class="red">Regarding the number of speakers</h3>

<p><b><i>Irish Gaelic</i></b> is today spoken by a few ten-thousands of people
  in the gaeltachts as their mother tongue, and we'll say a few handred-thousand,
  who master it to the degree of fluency. According to the Census, 1.4 Million
  Irish citizens of the Republic would consider themselves (40%) as Irish-speaking,
  as well as 143 000 (10%) in Northern Ireland (Tuaisceart Éireann). <br>
  It is the first official language in the Republic of Ireland (Poblacht na hÉireann)
  and therewith also an official language of the European Union (An Comhphobal
  Eorpach), where one can be convinced by glimpse in a passport (Pas) and a driver's
  license (Ceadúnas Tiomána). <br>
  <b><i>Scottish Gaelic</i></b> is spoken by just under 70 000 and mainly on the
  westward lying islands (Hebriden) and in the Highlands. Of course there are
  also those in Glaschu (Glasgow) and Dùn Eideann (Edinburgh) and other
  cities in Scotland (Alba), who keep up the ancestral tongue of their forefathers
  (and mothers). Not to be confused with Gaelic is Scots (or Lallans), a germanic
  language related to English language of the scottish Lowlands. <br>
  Nova Scotia (Alba Nua) in Canada isn't just a name, there are also those there
  who speak Gaelic (on Cape Breton Island). <br>
  <b><i>Manx Gaelic</i></b>, since the death of the 93 year-old Ned Madrell in
  the year 1974, has amongst the 80 000 inhabitants of the Isle of Man (Ellan
  Vannin) not a single native speaker. It is, by a few hundred people, increasingly
  being maintained, or better, revived. According to the 1991 census there were
  634 Manx speakers, and in the last census in 2001 already 1689 (2.2% der Bevölkerung).
</p>
<h3 class="red">the Script</h3>

Irish is written in the latin alphabet, or so it seems. Older documents and decorative
inscriptions use also an older calligraphic style (Cló Gaelach) , which
has hardly changed in over 1000 years, here is the alphabet: <br>
<img src="clogael.gif" height="47" width="538" alt="An Aibitír">
<br>
Here a <a href="ortho1.htm">sample text</a> (The Lord's Prayer) <br>
Before the introduction of the latin script, one wrote in Ogham script (those
are slanted lines engraved in stone edges). <br>
The <a href="ortho.htm">orthography</a> demonstrates even in modern script some
unique qualities. <br>
So, the letters j, k, q, v, w, x, y, z are missing completely (except in foreign
words). All other consonants exist practically twofold, because one differentiates
between a <b class="lightgreen">"broad" and "slender" consonant.</b>
These exist as phonemes in German as well, but there is makes no difference in
the meaning, as to which one is taken (if one speaks "ich" correct or with a "ch"
as in "Bach" it doesn't matter, everyone knows that my humble self is intended.
Furthermore, the"ch" is already the only sound, where any difference is noticed
in German). <br>
In Irish, the differences are much more important. If one book or many, it's only
discernable by listening to the final consonant: a slender r means "books"
(leabhair) a broad one denotes "a book" (leabhar). <br>
Unfortunately, the latin alphabet only contains one of each "b", "c", "d", "f",
etc. <br>
To make the difference clear between "broad" and "slender" in writing, one takes
the aid of vowels. <br>
Preceding and following a <i>slender</i> one writes a <i>slender</i> vowel (e,
i), next to a <i>broad</i> consonant, <i>broad</i> vowels (a, o, u). This means
that a portion of the vowels aren't intended to be spoken,&nbsp; e.g. das "i"
in "leabhair". <br>
Should a broad vowel be framed by 2 slender phonemes, one must, for better or
for worse, write 3 vowels, namely: 2 slender (before and after the broad vowel),
that is spoken in the end as one (which partially explains the abundance of vowels
in Irish words).
<p>Those wishing to acquaint themselves with the <b><i>difference</i></b> between
  a, let's say, <i>broad B</i> and a <i>slender B </i>, should start by forming
  their lips as if they were produce a B and try at the same time to say "bó"
  (Irish for "cow"), then try the same, this time with "bí" (bí
  = Irish "be!"), then compare the positioning of the lips used. <br>
  As one can see, we automatically take a slender b before e, i and a broad before
  a, o, u. <br>
  In Irish it is only allowed to speak before a broad vowel a slender consonant
  and vice versa! <br>
  So, form your lips again to a "bi" but then say "bo", without changing your
  lip formation. What comes out now is the Irish word "beo" = "lively". If you
  do it exactly the other way around (lips pouted for "bo" and then saying "bi"),
  you get the word "buí" = "yellow". In the process you're making little
  glides, a bit like a "y" in the case of beo, and a little like "u" in the case
  of buí. Keep in mind that these are never strong, clear y and u, and
  heaven forbid you go saying "byo" or "buoy"! <br>
  The words "bo" and "beo" as well as "bí" and "buí" differ only
  in their "broad" consonant B, the "e" in beo and the "u" in buí are technically
  unvoiced, they serve only the purpose of denoting the B as "broad" or "slender".
<p>It is principally impossible, that a consonant preceded by "i" and then directly
  followed by an "a". For example, "icha": this would lead to confusion (is that
  "ch" broad as in ach (kh) or slender as in ich (xh)) <br>
  In this aspect, the Irish lexicography is quite clear: is can only be written
  <i>ichea</i>, or<i> iacha </i> (whatever those may mean).
<p>Another difficult part is presented by <b><span class="lightgreen">l</span><span class="lightgreen">enition
  (seimhiú)</span></b>: following some consonants appears an h, which alters
  the consonant quite considerably in the pronunciation. To many, this is a help:
  c to ch, p to ph, b to bh ("w"). Others are a bit odd: m to mh (like "v"), g
  to gh (broad gh: a bit like g in berlinerisch "sagen", slender gh: like y),
  d to dh (like gh), s to sh ("h"), t to th (also"h"), an fh disappears in the
  pronunciation completely. <br>
  In older texts one finds, in place of the h, a dot above the lenited consonant
  (it looks then much clearer then).
<p>Often one finds at the beginning of a word combinations like gc, bp, nd, dt,
  bhf, but have no fear, one only needs here to pronounce the first consonant,
  also g, b, n, d, bh (a lenited b). The second is left out ("eclipsed" as the
  latin speakers say, and from this comes the name of this phenomenon: <b><span class="lightgreen">e</span><span class="lightgreen">clipsis
  (urú)</span></b>. <br>
  To simply not write the second consonant, is not something to wish for, for
  it helps immensely in the recogniseability of the word. (otherwise one wouldn't
  know if "bhear" was an eclipsed "fear" or a lenited "bear". When you see bhfear
  it's clearer, and one can open the dictionary under "fear" and find "man", if
  you looked up "bear" you would only find "béar = bear" or "beár
  = Bar" ) <br>
  Just to be thorough: an eclipsed g is ng, but is still spoken like "ng".
<p><b><i><span class="lightgreen"><a href="lenition.htm">Lenition</a></span></i></b>
  and <b><i><span class="lightgreen"><a href="eklipse.htm">eclipsis</a></span></i></b>
  are grammar rules that govern the mutations of words depending on the case,
  number, with or without article etc. and only the initial ones! Irish alters
  words not only at the beginning but also at the end. This is a bit frightening,
  for one must finally recognize a word from the spoken language by its stem.
  Changes to this make the task of the learner all the more difficult. He who
  starts swearing here, can recall learning German. Stuff like that doesn't happen
  there (or only orally) but for that we switch around the vowels or pull umlauts
  out of the middle of nowhere, which certainly causes the temporal arteries of
  learners of German sicher oft to swell in exasperation. (here's a good example:
  schwölle, schwellt, schwillt, geschwollen, der Schwall:-) )
<p>As with "béar/beár" one finds over many a vowel and accent mark,
  <b><span class="lightgreen">s</span><span class="lightgreen">íneadh fada</span></b>
  or short, <b class="lightgreen">fada</b>. This does not apply to the
  accentuation, but to the length of the vowels, without such marks, the vowels
  are mostly spoken as short. This has a very good reason. "fear" differs from
  "féar" only in this little "tick", but the one is spoken [fär]
  and the other [fe:r], the first meaning "man" the second "grass". If one had
  seen a bear (béar) or a bar (beár) is also no moot point (also
  when the former implies that you have seen the latter, in such a bearless but
  bar-rich place like Ireland :-)
<p>As one can see, the wads of letters that appear in Irish words do follow a
  rhyme and reason after all. Although one can't exactly say that Irish is "written
  as spoken"! As a consolation it should be said that before the spelling reform
  in the 50s the written word was much more complicated and significantly different
  from the spoken. English or French orthography isn't exactly easy either.
<p>To whomever, despite all the conflicting interests and the not exactly impressive
  number of possible conversational partners, wants to learn Irish, may they be
  getting a "Go n-éirí an bóthar leat" with them on their
  way.
