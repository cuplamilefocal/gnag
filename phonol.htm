<p>In <b>phonology</b> the <i>sounds</i> of a language are described, the written
  result of these sounds does not belong to that and is secondary. <br>
  The Irish <i>written language</i> is for this reason discussed separately in
  the chapter <a href="ortho.htm">orthography</a> , with (further) guidelines
  about the pronunciation.
<p><b>Note about the depiction:</b> <br>
  The depiction of the sounds should actually be done using the IPA symbols (IPA
  = international phonetic alphabet). <br>
  But this is dependent on the font, and is still not feasible in HTML in a way
  in which all, regardless of what platform they use, can see. <br>
  It is for this reason that there are partially "substitutes" used here. <br>
  Some of these symbols are common as modified IPA symbols for Irish, so the apostrophe
  ['] for slender (palatal) consonants and with that the forms [x'] for [ç],
  [s'] for [<font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>] and [z'] instead of [<sub><img src="z.gif" width="9" height="14" border="0" alt=""></sub>];
  as well as [L], [N], [R] for "tensed l, n, r" (in the IPA these are normally
  used for depicting other phonemes). <br>
  The fricatives [f] and [v] are partially spoken bilabial, partially also labiodental,
  for both the Irish transcriptions are normally without a difference [f] and
  [v] are used (actually according to the IPA they are only for the labiodental
  variants, [φ] and [β] would be the bilabial symbols). <br>
  As actually also in the modified IPA not-conform replacement symbols, there
  remains here only [ng] for the velar nasal (in IPA ein [<sub><img src="ng.gif" width="9" height="14" border="0" alt="ng"></sub>]),
  [@] for the neutral vowel (in IPA a [<img src="schwa.gif" width="8" height="10" border="0" alt="schwa">]),
  [å] for a back a (in IPA a [<img src="aa.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0" alt="a">])
  as well as [?] for the glottal stop (in IPA a [<img src="glott.jpg" width="8" height="14" border="0" alt="glottaler Verschlusslaut">]).
<p>I don't have here any listenable examples (in form of soundfiles) of the sounds
  of Irish but there are some to be heard on the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230412112354/http://www.fiosfeasa.com/bearla/language/sounds.htm" target="_blank">Fios
  Feasa: The Sounds of Irish</a> (there one finds the sounds of the Munster dialect)
<h2><a name="einf"><span class="red">the</span><span class="red"> vowels
  (na gutaí)</span></a></h2>

There is a difference made between long and short vowels.<br>
In the artificial <i>Lárchanúint</i> (central dialect) there are:
<ul><li>long vowels: [a:], [e:], [i:], [o:], [u:],</li>
  <li>short vowels: [a], [e], [i], [o], [u], [@]</li>
</ul>

<p>The vowels [a], [o], [u] count as <i>broad</i> <br>
  The vowels [e] and [i] count as <i>slender</i>
<p>Not only those vowels marked with an accent in writing (á, é,
  í, ó, ú) are long. Also preceding certain consonants the
  vowels are lengthened (e.g. preceding -rd, -nn, -rr, -ll, -m), if the word is
  monosyllabic, also further combinations lead to vowel lengthening (see <a href="ortho.htm">orthography</a>)
<p>In Ulster, <i>all</i> vowels in an unstressed syllable are short, otherwise
  long vowels remain clear (and are not reduced to [@], as it happens with short
  vowels). <br>
  The [a:] is often spoken in Munster/Connacht as a "back a", similar to the scandinavian"å"
  (technically: an opem back unrounded vowel). In Ulster it is an [æ:],
  only the Lárchanúint uses a normal long [a:] <br>
  Furthermore, in Connacht/Munster there is the [æ] instead of an [a] in
  some combinations. <br>
  In Ulster, there is partially the [&#x0448;], which ist an unrounded ü-sound
  (technically: a closed back unrounded vowel), in Irish orthography <i>"ao"</i>,
  which is otherwise appearing as [i:] (Standard, Connacht) or [e:] (Munster)
  , e.g. <i>saor</i> [si:r], [se:r], [s&#x0448;r]
<p><b>the neutral vowel (schwa) [<img src="schwa.gif" width="8" height="10" border="0" alt="schwa">]</b>
<ul>
  <li>It ia an "unarticulated" short sound, neither a nor e nor i. In German one
    calls it the "Murmel-e".</li>
  <li>In phonetic transcriptions it is a (according to the IPA-Umschrift) [<img src="schwa.gif" width="8" height="10" border="0" alt="schwa">],
    but here a [@] is substituted (Blume = [Blu:m@]) <br>
    e.g.: <i>broad = leathan</i> [l'æh@n], <i>eile = other</i> [el'@] <br>
    (in some transcriptions an i-coloured "slender" schwa-sound is separated from
    the standard schwa. <br>
    e.g.: <i>other = eile</i> [el'i]. But, this is actually not audible. <i>eile</i>
    sounds almost like the German word <i>Elle</i>. With that, the transcription
    [el'@] is preferable.)</li>
  <li>In an unstressed syllable, in many Irish dialects, <i>every</i> short vowel
    is spoken as a schwa ([@]) </li>
  <li>The <b> aux. vowel</b>: Sometimes, the schwa sound is not written, but spoken
    as an <a href="ortho.htm#cunta">auxilliary vowel</a> between certain consonants
    (see there): <br>
    e.g.: <i>blue = gorm</i> [gor@m], <i>name = ainm</i> [an'@m']</li>
  <li><b>Elision</b>: If in spoken Irish, a [@] comes up against another vowel,
    the [@] is omitted. <br>
    Should two [@] follow after another, only one [@] is spoken. <br>
    e.g.: <i>Tá sé <b>a</b>g ól = he drinks</i> [ta: s'<b>e:</b>go:l]
    <i>not</i> [ta: s'<b>e: @</b>g o:l] <br>
    <i>bail<b>e</b> áillainn = pretty town</i> [bal'<b>a:</b>l'inn] <i>not</i>
    [bal'<b>@ a:</b>l'inn] <br>
    <i>na gaotha aduaidh = the north wind</i> [n@ gi:h<b>@</b>du@j] <i>not</i>
    [n@ gi:h<b>@ @</b>du@j] <br>
    The a in ag [@g] or in gaotha [gi:h@] or the e in baile [bal'@] is not spoken
    in such cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="diph"><span class="red">the</span><span class="red"> dipthongs
  (na défhogair)</span></a></h2>
<p>There are the following dipthongs:
<ul>
  <li>[au] e.g.: <i>amh</i> in <i>amhras</i> [aur@s] (= doubt)</li>
  <li>[ai] e.g.: <i>adha</i> in <i>radharc</i> [rairk] (= view)</li>
  <li>[ei] e.g.: <i>eidh</i> in <i>beidh</i> [b'ei] (= will be)</li>
  <li>[u@] e.g.: <i>ua</i> in <i>fuar</i> [fu@r] (= cold)</li>
  <li>[i@] e.g.: <i>ia</i> in <i>ciall</i> [k'i@l] (= sanity)</li>
</ul>
<p>in some dialects there are also the sounds [oi], [@i], [ui], [ou].
<h2><a name="kon"><span class="red">the consonants (na consain)</span></a></h2>
<p>The consonants are classified depending their point of origin (bilabial, dental,
  alveolar, velar, glottal) and by their nature of production (plosives = stops,
  fricatives, nasals , liquids). Many consonants have an unvoiced and a voiced
  version (e.g.: [p]/[b], [t]/[d], [k]/[g], etc.) <br>
  Although, there are no truly aspirated consonants (<i>k, p, t</i>, are always
  aspirated in German)
<ul>
  <li><b>Bilabials</b>:
    <ul type="square"><li>plosives: [p], [b]</li>
<li>fricatives: [f], [v], [w]</li>
<li>nasals: [m]</li></ul>
Also [f] and [v] are often spoken bilabially, i.e. they are formed with both the
    upper and lower lip.(in German these sounds are labiodental, i.e. with the
    lower lip and the upper row of teeth or vice versa). <br>
    [w] (a semivowel) is often at the beginning of a word (in Connacht/Donegal)
    used as the velar form of the (palatal) [v] ; within a word always [v], if
    spoken as a consonant. </li>
  <li><b>Dentals</b>:
    <ul type="square"><li>plosives: [t], [d]</li>
<li>liquids: [l]</li>
<li>nasals: [n]</li></ul>
The dental fricatives [θ] and [ð] (equiv to the engl. <i>th</i> in <i>thing</i>
    and <i>that</i>) no longer exists in Irish (replaced with [h] and [γ])</li>
  <li><b>Alveolars</b>:
    <ul type="square">
<li>fricatives: [s], [z]</li>
<li>liquids: [r]</li></ul>
The broad [r] ist a rolled tip-of-the-tongue-r, the slender [r'] is rather complicated.
    <br>
    The broad Irish s is always an unvoiced s [s] <br>
    The voiced s-sound ([z]) only appears in foreign words: <i>zoo = zú</i>
    [zu:]. <br>
    (in a few dialects also as an eclipse of the s: e.g.: <i>ag an tsagart</i>
    [eg'@ zag@rt])</li>
  <li><b>Palatoalveolars</b>:
    <ul type="square">
<li>fricatives: [<font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>], [<font size="-1">3</font>]</li></ul>
The slender s ist always the same as an unvoiced german "sch" ([<font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>]).
    In transcriptions simply [s'] is used. <br>
    The voiced variation [<font size="-1">3</font>]  only appears in a few
    foreign words of English origin. In transcriptions, one uses  [z']
    e.g. <i>jab = job</i> [d'z'ab] for simplicity. </li>
  <li><b>Velars</b>:
    <ul type="square"><li>plosives: [k], [g]</li>
<li>fricatives: [x], [γ]</li>
<li>nasals: [ng]</li></ul>
Also those consonants formed on the soft palate (Velum) are divided into broad (velar) and slender (palatal)  (see below)
<br>
    [γ] is equivalent to the  modern Greek letter γ (Gamma).
    A broad [γ] is a "voiced ch", like g in a Berlinerisch "Wagen" or Spanish
    "Tarragona", a slender [γ'] is the same as a [j] like the German j in "ja".
    <br>
    A broad [x] like ch in the German "ach", the slender [x'] is equivalent to [ç] like ch in the German "ich".</li>
  <li><b>Glottals</b>:
    <ul type="square"><li>stops: [?]</li>
<li>fricatives: [h]</li>
</ul>
The glottal stop,  [?], e.g. in the German "Aorta"
    [?a?orta] is virtually unknown to modern spoken Irish. An abrupt
    collision of vowels (Hiatus) is avoided. The glottal stop is, however, often still used in traditional Irish vocals (sean-nós)
    , also in Scottish Gaelic it is still quite commonly used (written
    mostly as <i>th</i>) <br>
    The disappearance of the  glottal stop in Irish leads to a mingling and  lengthening
    of vowels, if consonants then devoiced (e.g. <i>athair</i> Standard [ah@r'] but
    Cois Fhairrge with a voiceless [h]: [æ:r']) <br>
    [h] appears only as a produkt of lenition of t and s  (<i>th, sh</i>), as well as  the h-prefix. Occasionally, also f is spoken as [h] <br>
    [h] connects to  voiced [b], [g], [d], [v] and makes these voiceless
    ([p], [k], [t], [f]), e.g. <i>sciobtha</i> [s'kip@] instead of  [s'kibh@] <br>
    between vowels,  [h] always disappears in Cois Fhairrge, and the vowels mingle: e.g. <i>beatha</i> [b'ah@] &gt; [b'æ:]</li>
</ul>

<h3><i class="red">broad and slender (leathan agus caol)</i></h3>
<p>All consonants exist in two forms (with the exception of the [h]):
<ul><li>broad (velar) consonants: [p], [b], [v]/[w], [f], [m], [t], [d], [n], [l], [r], [s], [z], [k], [g], [x], [γ], [ng]</li>
<li>slender (palatal) consonants: [p'], [b'], [v'], [f'], [m'], [t'], [d'], [n'], [l'], [r'], [s'], [z'], [k'], [g'], [x'], [γ'], [ng']</li></ul>
<p>In phonetic transcriptions, a  small apostrophe ['] is used to denote the  slender variant.
<br>
The difference between the two  forms is important. The differences are also greater then the equivalent pairs in German or English.
<br>
In German,  only "ch" in "ach" [ax] (velar) and  in "ich" [iç] are woth mentioning, in Irish transcription: [ix'] (palatal))
<br>
In Irish,  the differences are also to be heard in [d] and [d'] or [t] and [t'] and others (partially, and especially in Ulster,  the slender consonants d,t are spoken like affricates: [dj], [tç] or [t<font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>])
<br>
It becomes especially obvious in the difference between [s] and [s']. A slender [s'] is always spoken like the German "sch" [<font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>].
<p>Specifics:
<br>
In combinations like sp-, sf-, sm- at the beginning of a word,  the s is always broad. e.g.: <i>spléach</i> [sp'l'e:x]
<br>
In the following combinations, the 1st  consonant is always broad : -cht, -rd, -rl, -rn, -rs, -rt. e.g.: <i>boichte</i> [boxt'@] not: [box't'@]
<br>
At the beginning of a word the  [r] is always broad: <i>rí</i> [ri:]
<p>It is important to note that broad consonants may also stand next to slender  vowels and also the other way around:  slender consonants next to broad vowels.
<br>
In German,   this is not possible. There, it is always only similar toned consonants and vowels beside one another (e.g. ach [ax], ich [ix']).
<br>
In Irish, the <a href="#gleit">glide</a> comes into use, in order to make this shift from  slender to broad, and vice versa, possible.
<p>The difference of broad and slender is made clear in the <i>orthography</i> through the neighbouring vowel signs.
<br>
e.g. seo [s'o], sin [s'in'], airgead [ar'@g'@d], airgid [ar'@g'@d']
<p>The difference between "broad" and "slender" consonants in Irish is equivalent to
  the difference between "hard" and "soft" consonants in slavic languages.
  <br>
  This is made clear e.g. in Russian, where necessary, through a soft character &#x044c;
  and a hard character &#x044a; : e.g. &#x0440;&#x0430;&#x0431;&#x043e;&#x0442;&#x0430;&#x0442;&#x044c;
  [rabotat'] = to work (soft &#x0442; [t'] durch &#x044c;); or through "soft"
  vowels like &#x044f;, &#x0451; and &#x044e; and the "hard" vowel &#x044b; (which is approximately
  the Irish <i>ao</i>).
<h3><i class="red">tensed l,n,r</i></h3>
<p>The consonants l,n,r are differentiated in some dialects in a tensed form [L], [N], [R] and the non-tensed form [l], [n], [r].  ([m] counts always as tensed, so therefore there's no need ofr a special notation)
<br>
The difference comes roughly in the precision of the pronunciation, [L], [N], [R] are somewhat lengthened, [l], [n], [r] are spoken a bit more lax.
[L], [N] are formed by a  pressing of the tongue on the front teeth, [l], [n] are produced on the  alveolae.
<br>
In written Irish, the  tensed variant (except at the beginning of a word) often expressed as a double (nn, ll, rr).
<p>Tensed consonants also have an effect on neighbouring vowels: <br>
  The "tension" reaches over to the neighbouring vowels. This is why they are either
  lengthened or diphthongised, if the tensed consonants are in a stressed syllable
  at the end of a word (or preceding further consonants): <br>
  In Munster, the  difference tensed/non-tensed was lost,
  only the vowels show dipthongisation or lengthening: <br>
  e.g. <i>donn</i> [daun] instead of [doN], <i>ceann</i> [k'aun] instead of [k'aN],
  <i>fillte</i> [f'i:l't'@] instead of [f'iL't'@]. <br>
  Only in Ring and Clare is  [i] also diphthongised: e.g. <i>cill</i> [k'ail]
  <br>
  In some dialects, (bes. Connemara) there is a lengthening and diphthongisation
  also in a sustaining of the  tensed consonants, but the diphthongisation is only with
  middle vowels <br>
  e.g. <i>donn</i> [dauN], <i>ceann</i> [k'å:N], <i>fillte</i> [f'i:L't'@]
  <br>
  In Ulster there is only lengthening, no dipthongs, <br>
  e.g. <i>donn</i> [du:N], <i>ceann</i> [k'æ:N], <i>fillte</i> [f'i:L't'@]
  <br>
  In the Lárchanúint,  the tensed consonants are completely ignored
  and handled like the non-tensed ones, and the vowels remain mostly short, <br>
  e.g. <i>donn</i> [don], <i>ceann</i> [k'an], <i>fillte</i> [f'il't'@]
<p><b>at the beginning of a word:</b> <br>
  Where the differences between tensed and non-tensed consonants remain, then
  it also applies that if [L], [N] at the beginning of a word as the unlenited form,
  then [l], [n] as the lenited form, <br>
  e.g.: <i>the book = an leabhar</i> [@ L'aur], <i>my book = mo leabhar</i> [m@
  l'aur] <br>
  tensed n [N] is also used in the eclipsed form (except ng): e.g. <i>ten
  doors = deich ndoras</i> [d'e: Nor@s], <i>ten fish = deich n-iasc</i> [d'e:
  N'i@sk] <br>
  Only the word <i>le</i> appears resistant to start with a non-tensed l  [l@]

<h2><a name="gleit"><span class="red">the</span><span class="red"> glides
  (na sleamhnóga)</span></a></h2>

In Irish,  slender (palatal) consonants can appear neighbouring  broad vowels
([a], [o], [u]) as well as broad (velar) consonants next to slender vowels
([e], [i]). <br>
When spoken, there then occur deliberate short glides, that don't really correlate to real phonemes: There is a palatal glide [<sup>j</sup>] and a velar glide [<sup>u</sup>]. In transcriptions, it is normally not included extra, just the palatal consonant is marked with an apostrophe ['] instead.
<br>
e.g.: beo [b'o] actually [b<sup>j</sup>o] (slender consonant b + broad vowel o)
<br>
e.g.: buí [bi:] actually [b<sup>u</sup>i:] (broad consonant b + slender vowel
i) <br>
In the case of a palatal s [s' bzw. <font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>] there is
no glide: seo [s'o] or [<font face="Symbol">&#242;</font>o] <br>
There also lacks a notation in <i>written Irish </i> of these glides.
Only the <i>broadness</i> or <i>slenderness</i> of the consonants is denoted by the
voiceless vowel signs: (e.g. the u in buí [bi:] or the e
in beo [b'o:]). <br>
These vowel signs could therefore be taken as a hint of such a glide  and are sometimes also known as "sleamhnóg".

<p>In some dialects, an [<sup>u</sup>] appears between some broad consonants (esp. [b, m]) and [a], e.g. <i>baile</i> [b<sup>u</sup>al'@], <i>maith</i> [m<sup>u</sup>a].

<h2><a name="bet"><span class="red">stress (an bhéim)</span></a></h2>

<h3><a name="wobet"><span class="lightgreen">stress within a word (an bhéim
  ghutha)</span></a></h3>

Depending on the  stress, one can differentiate into 2 dialect groups:
<p><b><i>1. Connacht and Ulster:</i></b> <br>
  In these dialects, the <b>stress</b> lies always <b> on the 1st syllable</b>.
  <br>
  In polysyllabic words, the syllables with long vowels get a secondary stress.
  <br>
  Only a few words are stressed on the 2nd syllable (in combinations, e.g. with
  unstressed prefixes like a-, is-, mostly adverbs): <i>aréir, anocht,
  istigh, atá</i>, some foreign words e.g. <i>tobac</i>) <br>
  Other prefixes get the main stress, intensifying prefixes (e.g. an- = very)
  are stressed right after the following syllable.
<p><b><i>2. Munster:</i></b>
<br>
Here, the rules governing stress are more complicated.
<br>
Mostly, is's also a case of <b>stress on the 1st syllable</b>, but then
<ul>
  <li><b>stress on the 2nd syllable</b> if
    <ul type="square">
      <li>the 2nd syllable contains a long vowel or a dipthong. <br>
        e.g.: cai<i>lín</i>, fuin<i>neog</i></li>
      <li>the 2nd syllable is <i>-ach(t)</i>  and no long vowel is in the
        1st and 3rd syllable. <br>
      e.g. sa<i>lach</i>, don<i>acht</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>stress on the 3rd syllable</b> if
    <ul type="square">
      <li>the 3rd syllable contains a long vowel or dipthong  and the other syllables
        are short <br>
      e.g. tuismi<i>theoir</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sabet"><span class="lightgreen">cadencing</span></a></h3>

<p><b>constantly unstressed words</b>
<p>The following  parts of speech are always unstressed (because they are proclitic or enclitic):
<ul>
  <li><i>personal and possessive pronouns</i> (as opposed to English or German!)
    <br>
    If the attention of the listener should be drawn to these words, it is not the stress but  (also unstressed) <a href="person.htm#emph">emphatic suffixes</a> are used:
<br>
e.g.: <i>mi<u>se</u> = me(!)</i>, <i>mo leabhar<u>sa</u> = my(!) book </i>, <i>ei<u>sean</u> = him(!)</i>.
<br>
    An additional possibility is the <a href="satz5.htm#Hervorheb.%20des%20s,%20o,%20vn">shift
    in the word order</a> in the clause: <br>
    e.g.: <i>is <u>mise</u> a rinne é = I(!) did it </i></li>
  <li><i>prepositions</i></li>
  <li><i>verbal particles</i> and <i>conjunctions</i></li>
  <li>the <i>article</i></li>
  <li>the <i>adverbial particle go</i></li>
<li>the <i>copula</i></li></ul>

<p><b>graduation of the stress within a sentence</b>
<ul>
  <li>subjects (except the pronoun) are emphasized stronger than the verb. <br>
    e.g.: Itheann an <i>fear</i> = The man eats.</li>
  <li>in copular clauses, the predicate is emphasized stronger than the subject.
<br>
e.g.: Is é an <i>múinteoir</i> an fear sin. = That man is the teacher.</li>
  <li>objects are emphasized stronger  than the subject
<br>
e.g.: Itheann an fear an <i>leite</i> = The man eats the porridge.
<br>
This is not the case, if the subject is a noun, but the object is only a  pronoun.
<br>
e.g.: Itheann an <i>fear</i> é = The man eats it.</li>
  <li>Genitive attributes, attributive and predicate adjectives and appositions are emphasized stronger than  the word they modify.
<br>
e.g.: an cailín <i>deas Éirennach</i> = the nice Irish girl </li>
  <li>Numbers are stressed the same as the word they modify (e.g. <i>dhá chapall</i> = 2 horses), in the case of two part numbers  at least the 2nd part is stronger (e.g. dhá chapall <i>déag</i> = 12 horses)</li>
  <li>adverbs and adverbial phrases are emphasized stronger than the verb.
<br>
e.g.: Tá mé i mo chónaí <i>i nGaillimh</i> = I live in Galway.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>interrogative sentences</b>
<p>In English,  interrogative clauses are denoted by an alteration in the intonation
   (comp. e.g.: "He's here." and "He's <em>here</em>?"). In Irish this is not commonplace.
