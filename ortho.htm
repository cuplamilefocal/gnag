<p>The orthography of Irish is at first a bit confusing. <br>
  In addition, the pronunciation and written Irish are not identical, especially
  the pronunciation varies from dialect to dialect. <br>
  Although, the order in which letters appear is not random, but follows specific
  rules. <br>
  One can just as well develop a feeling for how a written word is to be pronounced,
  spelling and pronunciation are certainly closer knit as in English or French.

<p>The names of the letters resemble those from the German: <br>

</p><p>Old tree names were once the alphabet,as taken over from the Ogham Alphabet:
  <br>
  a (ailm = white fir), b (beith = birch), c (coll = hazel), d (dair = oak), e
  (edad/eabhadh = poplar), f (fern/fearn = alder), g (gath/gort = ivy), h (uath
  = hawthorn), i (idad/&iacute;odhadh = yew), l (luis = rowan), m (muin = vine),
  n (nin/nion = ash), o (onn = gorse), p (peith = dwarf alder), r (ruis = holander),
  s (sail = willow), t (tinne/teithne = holly), u (&uacute;r = heather)
</p><p>The Irish Alphabet consists of:
</p><ul>
  <li> <b><font color="#cc0000">vowels (<i>guta&iacute;</i>)</font> a, e, i, o,
    u</b> <br>
    with an <b>acute accent (<i>sineadh fada</i>) </b>shows the length
    of the vowel: <b>&aacute;, &eacute;, &iacute;, &oacute;, &uacute;</b> <br>
    Although some vowels without accent be pronounced as long.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#cc0000">consonants <i>(consain)</i></font> b, c, d, f, g,
    h, l, m, n, p, r, s, t</b> <br>
    The <b>consonant h</b> serves as a notation <a href="lenition.htm">lenition</a>
    (bh, ch, dh, fh, gh, mh, ph, sh, th) and as the <a href="thnd.htm#h">h-prefix</a>
    (ha, he, hi, ho, hu), otherwise only to be found in foreign words. <br>
    The <b>consonants j, q, v, w, x, y, z</b> appear only in a few foreign words:
    . There isn't a <b>k</b> (even the name of k is written with c : c&aacute;)</li>
</ul>

<p>In old script there are also certain abbreviations in use, taken from tironic
  notes, a medieval short hand. Especially common is the symbol for agus (and):

  In modern writings, this is replaced by a 7 (e.g. 7rl. = agus araile = and so
  on). <br>
  Still common is <b>.i.</b> the sign for id est, in English i.e.. Written out
  it would be in Irish: <i>eadhon = es (is)</i> (an emphatic form of <i>ea</i>)
</p><h2>
<a name="caollecaol"></a><i><font color="#009900">Caol le caol agus leathan le leathan</font></i></h2>

In English <b>"<i>slender with slender and broad with broad</i>"</b> <br>
This is the most important rule in Irish spelling. <br>
It is also to be found in Scottish Gaelic.
<p> <b><font color="#ff0000">e, &eacute;, i, &iacute;</font></b> are termed in
  Irish as <b><font color="#ff0000">slender vowels (<i>guta&iacute; caola</i>)</font></b><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">a, &aacute;, o, &oacute;, u, &uacute;</font></b> and
  also the ligature <b><font color="#ff0000">ae</font></b> are termed as <b><font color="#ff0000">broad
  vowels (<i>guta&iacute; leathana</i>)</font></b>
</p><p> Those "slender" vowels are accompanied by consonants which are <b><font color="#ff0000">slender
  (<i>consain chaola</i>)</font></b> <br>
  And "broad" vowels are accompanied by consonants which are <b><font color="#ff0000">broad
  (<i>consain leathana</i>)</font></b>
</p><p> In German a slender consonant can be preceded by a slender vowel then follows
  by a broad one, differences in the pronunciation of the consonants are hardly
  noticed and are unimportant for the meaning. <br>
  Still, such differences are there: (i.e. im <i>ch</i> in <i>ich</i> and
  <i>ach</i>). In Irish, these differences are much more evident.
</p><p> In Irish, it goes like this:
</p><p>
</p><table bgcolor="#ffcc99" width="100%">
<tbody><tr><td><br>
      <b>preceding <i>and</i> directly following<font color="FF0000">broad</font>
      consonants <i>only </i>a <font color="FF0000">broad</font> vowel is allowed.
      <br>
      preceding <i>and</i> directly following <font color="FF0000">slender</font>
      consonants <i>only</i> a <font color="FF0000">slender</font> vowel is allowed.</b><br>
      <br></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>With that, it becomes very clear if the consonant is to be pronounced slender
  or broad. <br>
  i.e. combinations like <i>abe</i> or <i>abi</i> are next to impossible in Irish.
  <br>
  Possible is only e.g. <i>aba, abo, abu, abae</i> (broad b) or <i>ebi, ebe, ibi,
  ibe</i> (slender b)
</p><p> <b>What's the point?</b> <br>
  While in German, one has consonants that automatically fit to the accompanying
  vowels (think "ich" and "ach"), in Irish a broad consonant can directly follow
  a slender vowel and vice versa; the consonants are independent of the vowels.
  <br>
  This is only true of the <i>spoken</i> language. <br>
  In the written language, there would be no clarity as to if a consonant is broad
  or slender, if it were not for this rule. <br>
  This clarity is very much needed and is made possible in writing through the
  use of vowels. It is for this reason that broad consonants may only be framed
  by broad vowels, and slender consonants only by slender vowels. <br>
  Many written vowels serve only as a marker of the "broadness" or "slenderness"
  of the neighbouring consonants. I.e. vowels are inserted, which are <i>not to
  be spoken</i>!
</p><p><b>examples</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>between a broad vowel and slender consonant an <b>i</b> is inserted. <br>
    e.g.: <i>b&aacute;<b>i</b>d = boats</i></li>
  <li>between &iacute; and broad consonant an <b>o</b> is inserted. <br>
    e.g.: <i>b&iacute;<b>o</b>dh = it shall be</i></li>
  <li>between &eacute; and broad consonant an <b>a </b> is inserted. <br>
    e.g.: <i>f&eacute;<b>a</b>r = grass</i></li>
  <li>between a slender consonant and a an <b>e</b> is inserted. <br>
    e.g.: <i>f<b>e</b>ar = man , f<b>e</b>arr = better</i></li>
  <li>between a slender consonant and o an <b>e</b> is inserted. <br>
    e.g.: <i>t<b>e</b>o = warmer</i></li>
  <li>instead of &oacute; after slender consonants you write <b>eo</b>.<br>
    e.g.: <i>&eacute;ir<b>eo</b>idh m&eacute; = I will rise</i></li>
  <li>between a slender consonant and u an <b>i</b> is inserted. <br>
    e.g.: <i>fl<b>i</b>uch = wet</i>
</li></ul>
<br>
Depending if a broad or slender consonant is used, <i>words differ</i> often in
their <b>meaning, number or case:</b> <br>
<br><b>examples:</b>
<blockquote> e.g.<i> b&aacute;d = a boat, b&aacute;<b>i</b>d = boats, of a boat(gen.)</i>
  <br>
  the i in <i>b&aacute;<b>i</b>d </i> only serves to mark d as slender, it is
  not spoken [ba:d'] <br>
  e.g. <i>b&iacute;<b>o</b>dh = it shall be</i> <br>
  the o in <i>b&iacute;<b>o</b>dh</i> denotes the dh as broad, and is not spoken
  [b'i:x] </blockquote>
It is through this that many vowels appear in written Irish. <br>
This rule is practised consequently. <br>
In compound words this rule is not put in use (e.g. neamhbheo = neamh + beo).
Also with adverbs like <i>ar&iacute;s, ansin, anseo, ansi&uacute;d, aneas, aniar</i>
a.o. as well as prepositinoal pronouns like <i>ina, lena</i> are originally also
contractions, so that the rule does not take effect. There are hardly any other
exceptions, and if so, then well substantiated. e.g.: ospid&eacute;al (s in sp-
always is broad, therefore a broad vowel preceding sp, a slender vowel following)

<p>About the usage of vowels as a marker of the broadness or slenderness of consonants
  see above. <br>
  For information on Irish phonetics see <a href="phonol.htm">Phonology</a> <br>
  The following are only suggestions of the whole, without wanting to or being
  able to explain the pronunciation in full (due to the great variation in the
  dialects)
</p><p><b><font color="#ff0000">ao</font></b>: ao is spoken like a long e [e:] (in
  Munster) or like a long i [i:] (in Connacht, Ulster, Standard). Despite the
  pronunciation it counts as broad, and is also framed by broad consonants. Should
  a slender consonant follow, one writes <b><font color="#ff0000">aoi</font></b>.
  This is always pronounced [i:]. <br>
  <i>ao</i> used to be, and partially still is pronounced in Donegal as an unrounded
  [&uuml;]. <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">ae:</font></b> this is a long e [e:] (most <i>not</i>
  [&aelig;:]). While and despite the appearance of an e, it is considered broad!
  It is treated almost as one single letter. (prior to the spelling reform it
  was written "aedhea" e.g. in <i>Gaedheal &gt; Gael</i>). <br>
  So, an i must follow if the next consonant is slender: <b><font color="#ff0000">aei</font></b>.
  (e.g.: <i>Gaeilge</i> earlier <i>Gaedhilge</i>) <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">ei, &eacute;i</font></b>: Even though e is a slender
  vowel, it's followed by a (voiceless) i preceding slender consonants: (<i>&eacute;ire
  = Ireland</i> [e:r'@]) <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">ea</font></b>: the e actually serves only to the slenderness
  of a possible preceding consonant, so in the standard [a] following slender
  consonants (<i>fear</i> [f'ar]) Although in Connacht it's spoken like the German
  "&auml;" [&aelig; (<i>fear</i> [f'&aelig;]) <br>
  Etymologically, it was often the case that e was the spoken part, the later
  a served the broadness of the following consonant (old ir.: <i>fer = Mann</i>,
  new ir.: <i>fear</i>) <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">ai</font></b>: also often as "&auml;" [&aelig; <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">eo</font></b>: almost always a long o [o:]. In a few
  words as a short o [o]: <i>deoch, seo</i>. <br>
  "eo" takes the place of "&oacute;" after slender consonants. <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">abh, odh, ogh</font></b>: at the beginning or within
  a word often like German "au"(ow!) [au] (e.g. umlabht = Umlaut) <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">amh</font></b>: at the beginning or within a word in
  Cois Fhairrge also "au" [au], in remaining Connemara more like[av]. <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">adh, agh, eidh</font></b>: at the beginning or within
  a word often like the German "ai"(aye) [ai] <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">aidh, aigh</font></b>: at the beginning or within a
  word like the German "ai" [ai] <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">omh(a)</font></b>: long o [o:] <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">umh(a)</font></b>: long u [u:] <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">-th-</font></b>: actually [h],but in Cois Fhairrge
  the inital h is mostly omitted, neighbouring vowels fuse and become long: <i>athair</i>
  [ah@r'] or [&aelig;:r'] <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">-ch-</font></b>: slender ch [x'] as an initial often
  pronounced [h] and treated like th: <i>fiche</i> [fih@] or [fi:]
</p><p><b>pronunciation of the suffix <font color="#ff0000">-(a)idh, -(a)igh</font></b>
  <br>
  -(a)igh appears as a verb root and imperative (e.g. <i>&eacute;irigh = climb!</i>)
  and as the preterite of the 2nd conjugation (e.g. <i>d'&eacute;irigh s&eacute;
  = he climbed</i>) but also as the genitive of the noun -(e)ach: (e.g. <i>an
  mharcaigh = of the rider</i>). <br>
  -(a)idh takes its place next to genitive forms of the noun -adh (<i>an tsamhraidh
  = of summer</i>) and in prepositional pronouns of the 3rd person masc (<i>uaidh
  = from him</i>) as well as in verbal suffixes (e.g. <i>&oacute;lfaidh s&eacute;
  = he will drink</i>)

<p>The pronunciation [i:] in Nord-Connacht (Mayo) and Ulster is (outside of Donegal,

  In Connemara rather [@] (<i>Gaillimh = Galway</i> [gaL'@]) <br>
  The genitive form <b><font color="#ff0000">-(a)imhe</font></b> is universally
  pronounced [iv'@] (<i>Contae na Gaillimhe = County Galway</i> [koNde: n@ gaL'iv'@])
</p><p><br>

</p><h4> <a name="dubailte"></a><b><font color="#cc0000">Double consonants (<i>consain
  dh&uacute;bailte</i>)</font></b></h4>

O<i>nly</i> <b><font color="#ff0000">l, n, r</font></b> may be written double:
<b><font color="#ff0000">ll, nn, rr</font></b> (only between vowels, next to other
consonants only l, n, r) <br>
This affects the pronunciation. So werden e.g. in many dialects vowels in monosyllabic
words preceding ll, nn, rr are spoken mostly long or diphthongised. (as opposed
to German, where only short vowels precede double consonants) <br>
e.g. <i>donn [daun] = brown; barr [ba:r] = tip, fearr [f'aur] = better</i> <br>
On the other hand, ll, nn, rr in are in some dialects rather elongated ("stretched")
(e.g. <i>donn</i> [doN]), but also both (e.g. <i>donn</i> [dauN]). <br>
In Munster there is no stretching phenomenon for double consonants, nn is however
pronounced (e.g. Waterford) [ng] (e.g. the name of the Gaeltacht found there:
<i>An Rinn</i> [@ Ri:ng'], engl. <i>ring</i>)
<p>Other consonants appear only once. <br>
  Should by compound words or after presyllables it come to pass that other identical
  consonants follow, this must be prevented with a hyphen.(e.g. <i>mo chos-sa
  = my feet</i>). The hyphen has no effect on the pronunciation: e.g. [m@ xos@]
</p><p> Also <b><font color="#ff0000">-rd, -rl, -rn, -m. -ng, </font></b> at the end
  of a word will have a similar effect on preceding vowels as do <i>-ll, -nn,
  -rr</i>. Also in this case, the vowels are lengthened or diphthongised: <i>cam</i>
  [kaum], <i>ard</i> [a:rd], etc.
</p><p><a name="schwa"><b><font color="#cc0000">the Neutral- or Schwa-vowel</font></b></a>
</p><p>This vowel is in many languages the most common, and certainly is in Irish.
  <br>
  In only a few languages have meade the effort to transcribe this vowel, and
  so it is lacking in Irish as well. <br>
  In German the "e" does the most of the dirty work (like e in Blume [blu:m@],
  the so-called "mumbly e"). <br>
  In Welsh it's a non-terminalsyllabic "y", that's why there are so many Ys in
  Welsh. <br>
  In Irish is can be an a, e, i, o, or u, and in many dialects close to every
  short vowel in an unstressed syllable. <br>
  e.g. consain leathana = [cons@n' l'&aelig;@n@]

</p><h4> <a name="cunta"></a><font color="#cc0000">the Auxilliary Vowel <b><i>(an
  guta c&uacute;nta)</i></b></font></h4>

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>l, n, r</b></font> are not just any old consonants,
  but <i>liquids</i> and have noch so manche Besonderheit. Here, an important one:
  <br>
  Between&nbsp; l, n, r, following vowels and preceding b, bh, ch, g, m, mh, <br>
  (so in combinations like: <i>lb, nb, rb, lbh, nbh, rbh, lch, nch, rch, lg, ng*,
  rg, lm, nm, rm, lmh, nmh, rmh, rn</i>) one speaks an [@] (spoken wie e in Blume)
  , but it is never written. <br>
  This is the <b> auxilliary vowel</b> <i>(c&uacute;namh = help)</i> It is also
  called the <b>epenthetic vowel<i> </i></b><i>(epenthetic = inserted)</i>. </p>
<p>*: The consonant cluster <i>ng</i> are mostly to denote the velar nasal (like
  English<i>"ng"</i>), then no aux. vowel is needed. <br>
  only in a few cases would one pronounce <i>n</i> and <i>g</i> separately and
  only then is an aux. vowel inserted. (e.g. <i>th&aacute;inig &gt; thangamair =
  we came</i> [han@g@m@r'])
</p><p><b>examples:</b> <i>gorm</i> [gor@m] <i>= blue; dearg</i> [d'ar@g]<i> = red;
  leanbh </i>[l'an@bh]<i> = child; ainm </i>[an'@m']<i> = name; Colm</i> [Col@m];
  <i>dorcha</i> [dor@cha] <i>= dark</i> <br>
  If this aux. vowel was to be written, then most likely as "a" or "i": e.g.:
  *goram, *dearag, *leanabh, *ainim, *Colam, *doracha. But it is not done. <br>
  Today the writing of the aux. vowel is only following a double-l,n,r, e.g. <i>farraige
  = sea</i> (earlier <i>fairrge</i>)
</p><p>The aux. vowel allows for easier pronunciation. It is necessary due to the
  shortness of Irish vowels. <br>
  (very different from German: e.g. dt."Holm" is easy to pronounce without help,
  but the dt. o in Holm is much longer as the Irish o in Colm)
</p><p>In Munster, by cases of e.g. <i>cn, mn, gn</i>, also those at the beginning
  of a word (mn&aacute;, gn&oacute;, cn&aacute;mh)<a name="fnverweis1">[</a> <a href="#fn1">1</a>
  ] and other connections with l,n,r, an aux. vowel is inserted.
</p><h4> <a name="uru"><b><font color="#cc0000">Tongue Twisters like mb, gc, nd, bhf,

</p><h4> <a name="fremd"><b><font color="#cc0000">Foreign words</font></b></a></h4>

<p>Foreign words are tailored to meet the rules of Irish pronunciation and spelling.
  In this way they become almost impossible to recognise. <br>
  The flood of foreign words comes mostly via English, and their pronunciation
  of Latin words e.g. is often taken on and then set in writing. <br>
  When possible, Irish suffixes or. word stems are used<br>
  e.g. teilif&iacute;sean = television, s&iacute;ceola&iacute;ocht = Psychology
  (<i>s&iacute;c</i> from the Greek <i>psych</i> + Irish. <i>eola&iacute;</i>
  = sage+ Irish <i>-cht</i> as noun suffix) </p>
<h4><a name="reform">
<b><font color="#cc0000">the spelling reform</font></b></a></h4>

<p>In the 40s, a spelling reform took place, in which relatively thoroughly the
  written word was matched up with the pronunciation. The problems arising in
  the dialectical differences, making the necessity of a central "middle
  of the road" dialect. <br>
  With this, the written Irish became more similar to the pronunciation, but a
  complete congruence is not the case. The artificial <i>L&aacute;rchan&uacute;int
  (central dialect)</i> came into being as a result of this reform; in which the
  written Irish mirrors the pronunciation the most. <br>
  In the spelling reform, one omitted many of the letters that were voicelss in
  the majority of dialects, e.g. <i>-&oacute;chaidh &gt; -&oacute;idh, -uchadh &gt;
  -&uacute;, -aedhea- &gt; -ae-, -amhail &gt; -&uacute;il,-ighe &gt; &iacute;, -idhe
  &gt; &iacute;</i>, etc. In addition to this, there were conventions of spelling,
  whose roots are in the pronunciation: , <i>-ighea &gt; &iacute;o</i>, <i>ln/nl/dl
  &gt; ll</i>, <i>dn/nd &gt; nn</i>, etc. <br>
  Parallel to the spelling reform one switched from the Gaelic script (<a href="ortho1.htm">sample
  text </a>) to the modern script.

  Irish</b> only the lenited letters <b>f</b> and <b>s</b> were noted with a dot
  (the dot was generally used as a sign of deletion, <i>punctum delens</i>. Since
  a lenited f loses its voice, and a lenited s is spoken as h, they were, quasi,
  "deleted"). <br>
  lenited <b>c, p, t</b> were denoted with an h (<b>ch, ph, th</b>) , as "ch",
  "ph", "th" were known from the Latin (or from the Greek). <br>
  lenited <b>b, d, g, m</b> were completely without notation, because letter combinations
  like "bh", "dh", "gh"&nbsp; and "mh" were unknown to Latin speaking scholars.
  <br>
  First later, in Classical Irish became the dot over all lenited consonants the
  rule. Now, in the age of modern script, the h in its place (supposedly because
  typewriters had no key for dotted letters) <br>
  The letters <b>l, n</b> are lenitable in spoken Irish, but in the written form
  they remain unlenited. </font>
